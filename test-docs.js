    "abstract": "A challenging problem in designing pilot-scale carbon capture systems is to predict, with uncertainty, the adsorber performance and capture efficiency under various operating conditions where no direct experimental data exist. Motivated by this challenge, we previously proposed a hierarchical framework where relevant parameters of physical models were sequentially calibrated from different laboratory-scale carbon capture unit (C2U) experiments. Specifically, three models of increasing complexity were identified based on the fundamental physical and chemical processes of the sorbent-based carbon capture technology. Results from the corresponding laboratory experiments were used to statistically calibrate the physical model parameters while quantifying some of their inherent uncertainty. In this study, the parameter distributions obtained from laboratory-scale C2U calibration runs are used to facilitate prediction at a larger scale with no corresponding experimental results available. Initially, we describe the multiphase reactive flow model for a sorbent-based 1-megawatt carbon capture system then analyze results from an ensemble of simulations with the upscaled model. The simulation results are used to quantify uncertainty regarding the © 2017. This manuscript version is made available under the Elsevier user license http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ design's predicted efficiency in carbon capture. In particular, we determine the minimum gas flow rate necessary to achieve 90 percent capture efficiency with 95 percent confidence."

    "abstract": "Multiple cooperating robots are able to complete many tasks more quickly and reliably than one robot alone. Communication between the robots can multiply their capabilities and effectiveness, but to what extent? In this research, the importance of communication in robotic societies is investigated through experiments on both simulated and real robots. Performance was measured for three different types of communication for three different tasks. The levels of communication are progressively more complex and potentially more expensive to implement. For some tasks, communication can significantly improve performance, but for others inter-agent communication is apparently unnecessary. In cases where communication helps, the lowest level of communication is almost as effective as the more complex type. The bulk of these results are derived from thousands of simulations run with randomly generated initial conditions. The simulation results help determine appropriate parameters for the reactive control system which was ported for tests on Denning mobile robots."

    "abstract": "Although historically viewed as purely harmful, recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as important physiological regulators of intracellular signaling pathways. The specific effects of ROS are modulated in large part through the covalent modification of specific cysteine residues found within redox-sensitive target proteins. Oxidation of these specific and reactive cysteine residues in turn can lead to the reversible modification of enzymatic activity. Emerging evidence suggests that ROS regulate diverse physiological parameters ranging from the response to growth factor stimulation to the generation of the inflammatory response, and that dysregulated ROS signaling may contribute to a host of human diseases."

    "abstract": "The continued increase in Web usage, in particular participation in folksonomies, reveals a trend towards a more dynamic and interactive Web where individuals can organise and share resources. Tagging has emerged as the de-facto standard for the organisation of such resources, providing a versatile and reactive knowledge management mechanism that users find easy to use and understand. It is common nowadays for users to have multiple profiles in various folksonomies, thus distributing their tagging activities. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic consolidation of user profiles across two popular social networking sites, and subsequent semantic modelling of their interests utilising Wikipedia as a multi-domain model. We evaluate how much can be learned from such sites, and in which domains the knowledge acquired is focussed. Results show that far richer interest profiles can be generated for users when multiple tag-clouds are combined."

    "abstract": "Generation of superoxide (O2-) by the NADPH-dependent oxidase of polymorphonuclear leukocytes is an essential component of the innate immune response to invading microorganisms. To examine NADPH oxidase function during phagocytosis, we evaluated its activation and assembly following ingestion of serum-opsonized Neisseria meningitidis, serogroup B (NMB), and compared it with that elicited by serum-opsonized zymosan (OPZ). Opsonized N. meningitidis- and OPZ-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species by polymorphonuclear leukocytes peaked early and then terminated. Phosphorylation of p47phox coincided with peak generation of reactive oxygen species by either stimulus, consistent with a role for p47phox phosphorylation during NADPH oxidase activation, and correlated with phagosomal colocalization of flavocytochrome b558 (flavocytochrome b) and p47phox and p67phox (p47/67phox). Termination of respiratory burst activity did not reflect dephosphorylation of plasma membrane- and/or phagosome-associated p47phox; in contrast, the specific activity of phosphorylated p47phox at the phagosomal membrane increased. Most significantly, termination of oxidase activity paralleled the loss of p47/67phox from both NMB and OPZ phagosomes despite the continued presence of flavocytochrome b. These data suggest that 1) the onset of respiratory burst activity during phagocytosis is linked to the phosphorylation of p47phox and its translocation to the phagosome; and 2) termination of oxidase activity correlates with loss of p47/67phox from flavocytochrome b-enriched phagosomes and additional phosphorylation of membrane-associated p47phox."

Although two reactive sites were determined by susceptibility to trypsin (Lys(13) and His(40)), the inhibitory function was assigned only to the first site.

    "abstract": "The architecture for a mobile service robot is discussed. The paper covers aspects related to overall design and implementation. The robot architecture is of the hybrid deliberative/reactive behavioral type. The strategy is selection where planning is viewed as configuration. The architecture can be divided into three layers, one for deliberation, one for task execution, and one reactive layer. Scalability and a high degree of flexibility have been primary design goals, making it easy to reconfigure the system. The system has been built in an object oriented fashion. An application of the architecture has been tested in a significant number of missions in our lab, where one room has been setup as an ordinary living room."

    "abstract": "For many antibodies, each antigen-binding site binds to only one antigen molecule during the antibody's lifetime in plasma. To increase the number of cycles of antigen binding and lysosomal degradation, we engineered tocilizumab (Actemra), an antibody against the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), to rapidly dissociate from IL-6R within the acidic environment of the endosome (pH 6.0) while maintaining its binding affinity to IL-6R in plasma (pH 7.4). Studies using normal mice and mice expressing human IL-6R suggested that this pH-dependent IL-6R dissociation within the acidic environment of the endosome resulted in lysosomal degradation of the previously bound IL-6R while releasing the free antibody back to the plasma to bind another IL-6R molecule. In cynomolgus monkeys, an antibody with pH-dependent antigen binding, but not an affinity-matured variant, significantly improved the pharmacokinetics and duration of C-reactive protein inhibition. Engineering pH dependency into the interactions of therapeutic antibodies with their targets may enable them to be delivered less frequently or at lower doses."

In addition, the effects of physical and chemical phenomena that may distort the results of ion exchange equilibrium studies are examined and some guidelines are given on how to avoid these interferences."

Our model is formed by\\nintegrating connectionist, reinforcement, and symbolic learning methods\\nto perform on-line reactive learning. It adopts a two-level dual-representation\\nframework (Sun, 1995), with a combination of localist and distributed\\nrepresentation.

    "abstract": "Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2-3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40-50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics."

Obvious differences in cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and susceptibility of lysosome to Au NRs by different types of cells resulted in selective accumulation of Au NRs in the mitochondria of cancer cells. Their long-term retention decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species level that enhances the likelihood of cell death. These findings thus provide guidance for the design of organelle-targeted nanomaterials in tumor therapy."

    "abstract": "This paper summarizes the current views on coping styles as a useful concept in understanding individual adaptive capacity and vulnerability to stress-related disease. Studies in feral populations indicate the existence of a proactive and a reactive coping style. These coping styles seem to play a role in the population ecology of the species. Despite domestication, genetic selection and inbreeding, the same coping styles can, to some extent, also be observed in laboratory and farm animals. Coping styles are characterized by consistent behavioral and neuroendocrine characteristics, some of which seem to be causally linked to each other. Evidence is accumulating that the two coping styles might explain a differential vulnerability to stress mediated disease due to the differential adaptive value of the two coping styles and the accompanying neuroendocrine differentiation."

We are currently gaining insight into important sources of reactive oxygen species in the vessel wall, including the NADPH oxidases, xanthine oxidase, uncoupled nitric oxide synthase, and mitochondrial sources. Although various reactive oxygen species have pathological roles, some serve as important signaling molecules that modulate vascular tone, growth, and remodeling. In the next several months, a series of articles in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology attempt to further elucidate how reactive oxygen species are produced by vascular cells and the roles of these in vascular homeostasis. This series promises to provide a valuable update on a wide variety of issues related to the biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology of these important and fascinating molecules. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of virtually every stage of vascular lesion formation, hypertension, and other vascular diseases. Upcoming series of articles in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology help elucidate how reactive oxygen species are produced by vascular cells and their role in vascular homeostasis."

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g. nitric oxide, NO(*)) are well recognised for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. ROS and RNS are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of ROS (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain \"redox balance\" termed also \"redox homeostasis\". The \"two-faced\" character of ROS is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that ROS within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, ROS can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular \"redox homeostasis\"; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of ROS in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of ROS in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury."

    "abstract": "Human locomotion must be flexible in order to meet varied environmental demands. Alterations to the gait pattern occur on different time scales, ranging from fast, reactive adjustments to slower, more persistent adaptations. A recent study in humans demonstrated that the cerebellum plays a key role in slower walking adaptations in interlimb coordination during split-belt treadmill walking, but not fast reactive changes. It is not known whether cerebral structures are also important in these processes, though some studies of cats have suggested that they are not. We used a split-belt treadmill walking task to test whether cerebral damage from stroke impairs either type of flexibility. Thirteen individuals who had sustained a single stroke more than 6 months prior to the study (four females) and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects were recruited to participate in the study. Results showed that stroke involving cerebral structures did not impair either reactive or adaptive abilities and did not disrupt storage of new interlimb relationships (i.e. after-effects). This suggests that cerebellar interactions with brainstem, rather than cerebral structures, comprise the critical circuit for this type of interlimb control. Furthermore, the after-effects from a 15-min adaptation session could temporarily induce symmetry in subjects who demonstrated baseline asymmetry of spatiotemporal gait parameters. In order to re-establish symmetric walking, the choice of which leg is on the fast belt during split-belt walking must be based on the subject's initial asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that cerebral stroke survivors are indeed able to adapt interlimb coordination. This raises the possibility that asymmetric walking patterns post-stroke could be remediated utilizing the split-belt treadmill as a long-term rehabilitation strategy."

However, being toxic molecules, they are also capable of injuring cells.Howthis conflict is resolved in plants is largely unknown. Nonetheless, it is clear that the steady-state level of ROS in cells needs to be tightly regulated. In Arabidopsis, a network of at least 152 genes is involved in managing the level of ROS. This network is highly dynamic and redundant, and encodes ROS-scavenging and ROS-producing proteins. Although recent studies have unraveled some of the key players in the network, many questions related to its mode of regulation, its protective roles and its modulation of signaling networks that control growth, development and stress response remain unanswered."

Although medical science has productively focused on the pathophysiology of disease, such as tumor biology, coronary artery disease, and immunology, it has done so at the expense of studying the body's psychophysiological reactions to these disease processes. These reactions are mediated by brain and body mechanisms, including the endocrine, neuroimmune, and autonomic nervous systems. While a large portion of the variance in any disease outcome is accounted for by the specific local pathophysiology of that disease, some variability must also be explained by host resistance factors, which include the manner of response to the stress of the illness. For example, in a series of classic experiments in animals, Riley1-2 showed that crowding accelerated the rate of tumor growth and mortality. In a . . ."

This study operationalizes Bourdieu's concept of symbolic capital in order to map dimensions of risk description and prescription onto a journalistic field of industry, environmentalist, scientific, and political media. Results show that conventional definitions of risk mirror an opposition between scientific and political discourses. Prescriptions for action on risk are partly autonomous from definitions however. Environmentalist and scientific media feature more proactive discourse, and industry and political media feature more reactive discourse. Implications for future research on climate risk and relational studies of media discourse are discussed."

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a major role in diabetes as well as in Alzheimer's disease and other related neurological diseases. Intracellular oxidative stress arises due to the imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen/reactive nitrogen species and cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms. In turn, the excess reactive oxygen/reactive nitrogen species mediate the damage of proteins and nucleic acids, which have been shown to have direct and deleterious consequences in diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Oxidative stress also contributes to the production of advanced glycation end products through glycoxidation and lipid peroxidation. The advanced glycation end products and lipid peroxidation products are ubiquitous to diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and serve as markers of disease progression in both disorders. Antioxidants and advanced glycation end products inhibitors, either induced endogenously or exogenously introduced, may counteract with the deleterious effects of the reactive oxygen/reactive nitrogen species and thereby, in prevention or treatment paradigms, attenuate or substantially delay the onset of these devastating pathologies."

    "abstract": "Various commonly used organic solvents were dried with several different drying agents. A glovebox-bound coulometric Karl Fischer apparatus with a two-compartment measuring cell was used to determine the efficiency of the drying process. Recommendations are made relating to optimum drying agents/conditions that can be used to rapidly and reliably generate solvents with low residual water content by means of commonly available materials found in most synthesis laboratories. The practical method provides for safer handling and drying of solvents than methods calling for the use of reactive metals, metal hydrides, or solvent distillation."

    "abstract": "Necrosis has been defined as a type of cell death that lacks the features of apoptosis and autophagy, and is usually considered to be uncontrolled. Recent research suggests, however, that its occurrence and course might be tightly regulated. After signaling- or damage-induced lesions, necrosis can include signs of controlled processes such as mitochondrial dysfunction, enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, ATP depletion, proteolysis by calpains and cathepsins, and early plasma membrane rupture. In addition, the inhibition of specific proteins involved in regulating apoptosis or autophagy can change the type of cell death to necrosis. Because necrosis is prominent in ischemia, trauma and possibly some forms of neurodegeneration, further biochemical comprehension and molecular definition of this process could have important clinical implications."

    "abstract": "In the framework of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), methodologies and experimental tests are presented for the problem of detecting and reacting to collisions between a robot manipulator and a human being. Using a lightweight robot that was especially designed for interactive and cooperative tasks, we show how reactive control strategies can significantly contribute to ensuring safety to the human during physical interaction. Several collision tests were carried out, illustrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. While a subjective ldquosafetyrdquo feeling is experienced by users when being able to naturally stop the robot in autonomous motion, a quantitative analysis of different reaction strategies was lacking. In order to compare these strategies on an objective basis, a mechanical verification platform has been built. The proposed collision detection and reactions methods prove to work very reliably and are effective in reducing contact forces far below any level which is dangerous to humans. Evaluations of impacts between robot and human arm or chest up to a maximum robot velocity of 2.7 m/s are presented."

    "abstract": "Iodine chemistry in the marine boundary layer has attracted increasing attention over the last few years because iodine oxides cause ozone destruction, change the atmospheric oxidising capacity, and can form ultrafine particles. However, the chemistry of iodine in polluted environments is not well understood: its effects are assumed to be inhibited by reactions involving NOx (NO2 & NO). This paper describes Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) observations of iodine species (I2, OIO and IO) and the nitrate radical (NO3) at a semi-polluted coastal site in Roscoff, France. Significant concentrations of IO and I2 were measured during daytime, indicating efficient recycling of iodine from iodine nitrate (IONO2). I2, IO, OIO and NO3 were observed at night. These observations are interpreted using a one dimensional model to demonstrate that iodine plays an important role even in polluted environments due to recycling mechanisms not considered previously."

    "abstract": "The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (Dox) is widely used as an antitumor agent in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. However, one of the limitations of its clinical use is that systemic administration of an effective dose of Dox results in nonselective cardiac toxicity and myelosuppression. In order to minimize this nonspecific toxicity, Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) was examined for its ability to serve as a macromolecular carrier for thermally targeted delivery of Dox. The ELP-based doxorubicin delivery vehicle (Tat-ELP-GFLG-Dox) consists of: (1) a peptide derived from the HIV-1 Tat protein to facilitate its cellular uptake, (2) ELP to allow thermal targeting, and (3) the lysosomally degradable glycylphenylalanylleucylglycine (GFLG) spacer and a cysteine residue conjugated to a thiol reactive doxorubicin derivative. Cytotoxicity of Tat-ELP-GFLG-Dox in MES-SA uterine sarcoma cells was enhanced 20-fold when aggregation of ELP was induced with hyperthermia. The ELP delivered doxorubicin displayed a cytoplasmic distribution and induced temperature dependent caspase activation."

State-of-the-art SOA models parameterize the results of simulation chamber experiments that bracket the conditions found in the polluted urban atmosphere. Here we show that in the real urban atmosphere reactive anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs) produce much larger amounts of SOA than these models predict, even shortly after sunrise. Contrary to current belief, a significant fraction of the excess SOA is formed from first-generation AVOC oxidation products. Global models deem AVOCs a very minor contributor to SOA compared to biogenic VOCs (BVOCs). If our results are extrapolated to other urban areas, AVOCs could be responsible for additional 3--25 Tg yr−1 SOA production globally, and cause up to −0.1 W m−2 additional top-of-the-atmosphere radiative cooling."

Leading people to consider others members' perspectives can reduce these egocentric (self-centered) judgments, such that people claim that it is fair for them to take less, but it actually increases egoistic (selfish) behavior, such that people actually take more of available resources. Four experiments demonstrate this pattern in competitive contexts where considering others' perspectives activates egoistic theories of their likely behavior, leading people to counter by behaving more egoistically themselves. This reactive egoism is attenuated in cooperative contexts. Discussion focuses on the implications of reactive egoism in social interaction, and on strategies for alleviating its potentially deleterious effects."

Antigens that stimulate self-reactive T cells may also activate natural T(reg) cells, thereby maintaining dominant self tolerance. Conversely, genetic anomalies or environmental agents that specifically or predominantly affect T(reg) cells cause or predispose to autoimmunity. With recent advances in our understanding of T(reg) cell development in the thymus and periphery and the molecular mechanism of T(reg) cell-mediated suppression, new ways of treating immunological diseases by targeting T(reg) cells at the cellular and molecular levels are envisaged."

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are specialized glial cells that outnumber neurons by over fivefold. They contiguously tile the entire central nervous system (CNS) and exert many essential complex functions in the healthy CNS. Astrocytes respond to all forms of CNS insults through a process referred to as reactive astrogliosis, which has become a pathological hallmark of CNS structural lesions. Substantial progress has been made recently in determining functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis and in identifying roles of astrocytes in CNS disorders and pathologies. A vast molecular arsenal at the disposal of reactive astrocytes is being defined. Transgenic mouse models are dissecting specific aspects of reactive astrocytosis and glial scar formation in vivo. Astrocyte involvement in specific clinicopathological entities is being defined. It is now clear that reactive astrogliosis is not a simple all-or-none phenomenon but is a finely gradated continuum of changes that occur in context-dependent manners regulated by specific signaling events. These changes range from reversible alterations in gene expression and cell hypertrophy with preservation of cellular domains and tissue structure, to long-lasting scar formation with rearrangement of tissue structure. Increasing evidence points towards the potential of reactive astrogliosis to play either primary or contributing roles in CNS disorders via loss of normal astrocyte functions or gain of abnormal effects. This article reviews (1) astrocyte functions in healthy CNS, (2) mechanisms and functions of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation, and (3) ways in which reactive astrocytes may cause or contribute to specific CNS disorders and lesions."

In the last 33 years, details of aspirin treatment have been refined to the point where it is now recognized and accepted as a major therapeutic intervention in the treatment of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, with therapeutic efficacy in approximately two-thirds of patients. It is only effective in patients who have aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and none of the other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, despite their cross-reactive inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1, can effectively take the place of aspirin."

    "abstract": "Cancer is a pathology that is associated with aberrant gene expression and an altered metabolism. Whereas changes in gene expression have historically been attributed to mutations, it has become apparent that epigenetic processes also play a critical role in controlling gene expression during carcinogenesis. Global changes in epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, have been observed in cancer. These epigenetic alterations can aberrantly silence or activate gene expression during the formation of cancer; however, the process leading to this epigenetic switch in cancer remains unknown. Carcinogenesis is also associated with metabolic defects that increase mitochondrially derived reactive oxygen species, create an atypical redox state, and change the fundamental means by which cells produce energy. Here, we summarize the influence of these metabolic defects on epigenetic processes. Metabolic defects affect epigenetic enzymes by limiting the availability of cofactors like S-adenosylmethionine. Increased production of reactive oxygen species alters DNA methylation and histone modifications in tumor cells by oxidizing DNMTs and HMTs or through direct oxidation of nucleotide bases. Last, the Warburg effect and increased glutamine consumption in cancer influence histone acetylation and methylation by affecting the activity of sirtuins and histone demethylases."

This biological paradox underlies mechanisms that are important for the integrity and fitness of living organisms and their ageing. The pathways that regulate ROS homeostasis are crucial for mitigating the toxicity of ROS and provide strong evidence about specificity in ROS signalling. By taking advantage of the chemistry of ROS, highly specific mechanisms have evolved that form the basis of oxidant scavenging and ROS signalling systems."

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) contribute to the pathogenesis and/or progression of several human diseases. Proteins are important molecular signposts of oxidative/nitrosative damage. However, it is generally unresolved whether the presence of oxidatively/nitrosatively modified proteins has a causal role or simply reflects secondary epiphenomena. Only direct identification and characterization of the modified protein(s) in a given pathophysiological condition can decipher the potential roles played by ROS/RNS-induced protein modifications. During the last few years, mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies have contributed in a significant way to foster a better understanding of disease processes. The study of oxidative/nitrosative modifications, investigated by redox proteomics, is contributing to establish a relationship between pathological hallmarks of disease and protein structural and functional abnormalities. MS-based technologies promise a contribution in a new era of molecular medicine, especially in the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers of oxidative/nitrosative stress, enabling early detection of diseases. Indeed, identification and characterization of oxidatively/nitrosatively modified proteins in human diseases has just begun."

    "abstract": "Age-related accumulation of cellular damage and death has been linked to oxidative stress. Calorie restriction (CR) is the most robust, nongenetic intervention that increases lifespan and reduces the rate of aging in a variety of species. Mechanisms responsible for the antiaging effects of CR remain uncertain, but reduction of oxidative stress within mitochondria remains a major focus of research. CR is hypothesized to decrease mitochondrial electron flow and proton leaks to attenuate damage caused by reactive oxygen species. We have focused our research on a related, but different, antiaging mechanism of CR. Specifically, using both in vivo and in vitro analyses, we report that CR reduces oxidative stress at the same time that it stimulates the proliferation of mitochondria through a peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor coactivator 1 alpha signaling pathway. Moreover, mitochondria under CR conditions show less oxygen consumption, reduce membrane potential, and generate less reactive oxygen species than controls, but remarkably they are able to maintain their critical ATP production. In effect, CR can induce a peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor coactivator 1 alpha-dependent increase in mitochondria capable of efficient and balanced bioenergetics to reduce oxidative stress and attenuate age-dependent endogenous oxidative damage."

    "abstract": "Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin involved in the recognition of beta-glucans found in the cell walls of fungi. We generated dectin-1-deficient mice to determine the importance of dectin-1 in the defense against pathogenic fungi. In vitro, beta-glucan-induced cytokine production from wild-type dendritic cells and macrophages was abolished in cells homozygous for dectin-1 deficiency ('dectin-1-knockout' cells). In vivo, dectin-1-knockout mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice to pneumocystis infection, even though their cytokine production was normal. However, pneumocystis-infected dectin-1-knockout macrophages did show defective production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast to those results, wild-type and dectin-1-knockout mice were equally susceptible to candida infection. Thus, dectin-1 is required for immune responses to some fungal infections, as protective immunity to pneumocystis, but not to candida, required dectin-1 for the production of antifungal reactive oxygen species."

    "abstract": "Life is the interplay between structure and energy, yet the role of energy deficiency in human disease has been poorly explored by modern medicine. Since the mitochondria use oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to convert dietary calories into usable energy, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a toxic by-product, I hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in a wide range of age-related disorders and various forms of cancer. Because mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in thousands of copies per cell and encodes essential genes for energy production, I propose that the delayed-onset and progressive course of the age-related diseases results from the accumulation of somatic mutations in the mtDNAs of post-mitotic tissues. The tissue-specific manifestations of these diseases may result from the varying energetic roles and needs of the different tissues. The variation in the individual and regional predisposition to degenerative diseases and cancer may result from the interaction of modern dietary caloric intake and ancient mitochondrial genetic polymorphisms. Therefore the mitochondria provide a direct link between our environment and our genes and the mtDNA variants that permitted our forbears to energetically adapt to their ancestral homes are influencing our health today."

Toward the validation of this distinction, groups of reactive aggressive, proactive aggressive, and nonaggressive children were identified (n = 624 9-12-year-olds). Social information-processing patterns were assessed in these groups by presenting hypothetical vignettes to subjects. 3 hypotheses were tested: (1) only the reactive-aggressive children would demonstrate hostile biases in their attributions of peers' intentions in provocation situations (because such biases are known to lead to reactive anger); (2) only proactive-aggressive children would evaluate aggression and its consequences in relatively positive ways (because proactive aggression is motivated by its expected external outcomes); and (3) proactive-aggressive children would select instrumental social goals rather than relational goals more often than nonaggressive children. All 3 hypotheses were at least partially supported."

    "abstract": "The reduction of oxygen to water proceeds via one electron at a time. In the mitochondrial respiratory chain, Complex IV (cytochrome oxidase) retains all partially reduced intermediates until full reduction is achieved. Other redox centres in the electron transport chain, however, may leak electrons to oxygen, partially reducing this molecule to superoxide anion (O2-*). Even though O2-* is not a strong oxidant, it is a precursor of most other reactive oxygen species, and it also becomes involved in the propagation of oxidative chain reactions. Despite the presence of various antioxidant defences, the mitochondrion appears to be the main intracellular source of these oxidants. This review describes the main mitochondrial sources of reactive species and the antioxidant defences that evolved to prevent oxidative damage in all the mitochondrial compartments. We also discuss various physiological and pathological scenarios resulting from an increased steady state concentration of mitochondrial oxidants."

    "abstract": "Free living organisms typically occur in harsh environments challenged by abiotic stresses of varying intensities. Taking ionizing radiation and caloric restriction as examples, environmental variation from benign to extreme gives a fitness-stress continuum where energetic efficiency, a measure of fitness, is inversely related to stress level. Hormesis occurs in benign regions for these examples. In contrast aging emphasizes survival towards the limits of survival under accumulating stress from Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS. An energetic evolutionary approach underlies an ecological aging theory based principally upon survival, which incorporates hormesis. Multiple environmental agents contributing to hormesis should be considered by those attempting to improve the quality of life by delaying the onset of senescence, so enhancing survival. Caloric restriction has wider acceptance in this process than ionizing radiation."

    "abstract": "Atherothrombosis of the coronary and cerebral vessels is understood to be a disorder of inflammation and innate immunity, as well as a disorder of lipid accumulation. From a vascular biology perspective, the processes of cellular adhesion, monocyte and macrophage attachment, and transmigration of immune cells across the endothelium are crucial steps in early atherogenesis and in the later stages of mature plaque rupture, particularly the transition of unstable plaque at the time of acute thrombosis. There is abundant clinical evidence demonstrating that many biomarkers of inflammation are elevated years in advance of first ever myocardial infarction (MI) or thrombotic stroke and that these same biomarkers are highly predictive of recurrent MI, recurrent stroke, diabetes, and cardiovascular death. In daily practice, the inflammatory biomarker in widest use is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); when interpreted within the context of usual risk factors, levels of hsCRP <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/l denote lower, average, and higher relative risk for future vascular events. Risk-prediction models that incorporate hsCRP, such as the Reynolds Risk Score, have been developed that improve risk classification and the accuracy for global risk prediction, particularly for those deemed at \"intermediate risk\" by usual algorithms, such as the Framingham Risk Score. With regard to cerebral vessels, increased biomarkers of inflammation, including hsCRP, have been associated with increased stroke risk as well as an increased rate of atherosclerosis progression in the carotid vessels. Although the proportion of variation in hsCRP explained by genetic factors may be as large as 20% to 40%, diet, exercise, and smoking cessation remain critical tools for risk reduction and CRP reduction. Statin therapy reduces hsCRP in a largely low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-independent manner, and the \"anti-inflammatory\" properties of these agents have been suggested as a potential mechanism beyond LDL reduction for the efficacy of these agents. The ongoing multinational Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial of 17,802 initially healthy men and women with low levels of LDL cholesterol but increased levels of hsCRP will help to define whether vascular protection can be achieved with statin therapy, even in the absence of hyperlipidemia. Targeted anti-inflammatory therapies are being developed that may provide a direct method of translating the biology of inflammation into new clinical treatments across multiple vascular beds. This article summarizes data supporting a role for inflammation in cardiovascular disease and offers the possibility that other disorders characterized by inflammation, such as periodontal disease, may have an indirect role by influencing the risk, manifestation, and progression of vascular events."

It then critically examines methods used to trap RS, including spin trapping and aromatic hydroxylation, with a particular emphasis on those methods applicable to human studies. Methods used to measure oxidative damage to DNA, lipids and proteins and methods used to detect RS in cell culture, especially the various fluorescent \"probes\" of RS, are also critically reviewed.

Inverters which connect distributed generation such as solar panels and pluggable hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to the grid are an example. Such devices are not currently utilized by the power system. We investigate the integration of these end-user reactive-power-capable devices to provide voltage support to the grid via a secure communications infrastructure. We determine effective locations in the transmission system and show how reactive power resources connected at those buses can be controlled. Buses belong to reactive support groups which parallel the regions of the secure communications architecture that is presented. Ultimately, our goal is to present how the smart grid can enable the utilization of available end-user devices as a resource to mitigate power system problems such as voltage collapse."

    "abstract": "© 2017 The Authors We present a novel computational model that describes action perception as an active inferential process that combines motor prediction (the reuse of our own motor system to predict perceived movements) and hypothesis testing (the use of eye movements to disambiguate amongst hypotheses). The system uses a generative model of how (arm and hand) actions are performed to generate hypothesis-specific visual predictions, and directs saccades to the most informative places of the visual scene to test these predictions – and underlying hypotheses. We test the model using eye movement data from a human action observation study. In both the human study and our model, saccades are proactive whenever context affords accurate action prediction; but uncertainty induces a more reactive gaze strategy, via tracking the observed movements. Our model offers a novel perspective on action observation that highlights its active nature based on prediction dynamics and hypothesis testing."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein is an inflammatory marker believed to be of value in the prediction of coronary events. We report data from a large study of C-reactive protein and other circulating inflammatory markers, as well as updated meta-analyses, to evaluate their relevance to the prediction of coronary heart disease. METHODS: Measurements were made in samples obtained at base line from up to 2459 patients who had a nonfatal myocardial infarction or died of coronary heart disease during the study and from up to 3969 controls without a coronary heart disease event in the Reykjavik prospective study of 18,569 participants. Measurements were made in paired samples obtained an average of12 years apart from 379 of these participants in order to quantify within-person fluctuations in inflammatory marker levels. RESULTS: The long-term stability of C-reactive protein values (within-person correlation coefficient, 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.66) was similar to that of both blood pressure and total serum cholesterol. After adjustment for base-line values for established risk factors, the odds ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.45 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.68) in a comparison of participants in the top third of the group with respect to base-line C-reactive protein values with those in the bottom third, and similar overall findings were observed in an updated meta-analysis involving a total of 7068 patients with coronary heart disease. By comparison, the odds ratios in the Reykjavik Study for coronary heart disease were somewhat weaker for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1.30; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.51) and the von Willebrand factor concentration (1.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.27) but generally stronger for established risk factors, such as an increased total cholesterol concentration (2.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.03 to 2.74) and cigarette smoking (1.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.62 to 2.16). CONCLUSIONS: C-reactive protein is a relatively moderate predictor of coronary heart disease. Recommendations regarding its use in predicting the likelihood of coronary heart disease may need to be reviewed. Copyright © 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society."

    "abstract": "The capacity to exercise control over the nature and quality of one's life is the essence of humanness. Human agency is characterized by a number of core features that operate through phenomenal and functional consciousness. These include the temporal extension of agency through intentionality and forethought, self-regulation by self-reactive influence, and self-reflectiveness about one's capabilities, quality of functioning, and the meaning and purpose of one's life pursuits. Personal agency operates within a broad network of sociostructural influences. In these agentic transactions, people are producers as well as products of social systems. Social cognitive theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: direct personal agency, proxy agency that relies on others to act on one's behest to secure desired outcomes, and collective agency exercised through socially coordinative and interdependent effort. Growing transnational embeddedness and interdependence are placing a premium on collective efficacy to exercise control over personal destinies and national life."

    "abstract": "Average lifespan has increased over the last centuries, as a consequence of medical and environmental factors, but maximal life span remains unchanged. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of aging and determinants of life span will help to reduce age-related morbidity and facilitate healthy aging. Extension of maximal life span is currently possible in animal models with measures such as genetic manipulations and caloric restriction (CR). CR appears to prolong life by reducing oxidative damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to cause deleterious effects on DNA, proteins, and lipids, and generation of these highly reactive molecules takes place in the mitochondria. But ROS is positively implicated in cellular stress defense mechanisms and formation of ROS a highly regulated process controlled by a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways. There are endogenous anti-oxidant defense systems that have the potential to partially counteract ROS impact. In this review, we will describe pathways contributing to the regulation of the age-related decline in mitochondrial function and their impact on longevity. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondria: the deadly organelle."

    "abstract": "Life-history theory assumes that animal life histories are a consequence of trade-offs between current activities and future reproductive performance or survival, because resource supply is limited. Empirical evidence for such trade-offs in the wild are common, yet investigations of the underlying mechanisms are rare. Life-history trade-offs may have both physiological and ecological mediated costs. One hypothesized physiological mechanism is that elevated energy metabolism may increase reactive oxygen species production, leading to somatic damage and thus compromising future survival. We investigated the impact of experimentally elevated energy expenditure on oxidative damage, protection and lifespan in short-tailed field voles (Microtus agrestis) maintained in captivity to remove any confounding ecological factor effects. Energy expenditure was elevated via lifelong cold exposure (7+/-2 degrees C), relative to siblings in the warm (22+/-2 degrees C). No treatment effect on cumulative mortality risk was observed, with negligible effects on oxidative stress and antioxidant protection. These data suggest that in captive animals physiologically mediated costs on life history do not result from increased energy expenditure and consequent elevations in oxidative stress and reduced survival."

    "abstract": "Reactive element-doped (Co,Mn) 3 O 4 spinel is considered as the most promising coating system to protect ferritic alloys for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application. In this paper, a CeO 2-doped (Co,Mn) 3 O 4 coating was synthesized on a Crofer 22 APU alloy substrate via electrolytic codeposition of a composite layer consisting of a Co matrix and embedded Mn 3 O 4 /CeO 2 particles, followed by thermal conversion of the deposited layer in air at elevated temperatures. After oxidation at 800°C in air for 250 h, no Cr penetration was detected in both the CeO 2-doped and CeO 2-free spinel coatings. However, CeO 2 doping significantly reduced the Cr 2 O 3 scale growth at the coating/substrate interface. An area specific resistance of 8 m ·cm 2 at 800°C was achieved for the CeO 2-doped coating sample, which was much lower than that of the CeO 2-free coating sample (13 m ·cm 2) or the bare substrate (24 m ·cm 2) at the same temperature. CeO 2 doping in the spinel coating also improved the performance stability of the anode-supported cell in contact with the alloy interconnect."

    "abstract": "Olanzapine was shown to be oxidized to a reactive intermediate by HOCl, which is the major oxidant produced by activated neutrophils. A mass spectrum obtained using a flow system in which the reactants were fed into a mixing chamber and the products flowed directly into a mass spectrometer revealed a reactive intermediate at m/z 311. This is 2 mass units less than the protonated molecular ion of parent olanzapine and suggests that the reactive intermediate is a nitrenium ion. The reactive intermediate could be trapped with glutathione or N-acetylcysteine to produce two conjugates. These data are analogous to results we reported previously with the structurally related atypical antipsychotic agent clozapine. However, the clozapine and olanzapine reactive metabolites showed differences in their ability to cause toxicity to human neutrophils. Toxicity to neutrophils was observed only at high concentrations of clozapine (>50 microM) when HOCl was used to generate reactive metabolite. In contrast, concentration-dependent toxicity (p < 0.05) was observed when neutrophils were incubated with clozapine (0-20 microM) and H2O2 to generate clozapine reactive metabolite. No toxicity was observed with clozapine alone (at concentrations of > 50 microM). Similar results were observed in monocytes and HL-60 cells. Olanzapine reactive metabolite only seemed to cause slight toxicity at the highest concentrations tested (20 microM), even when the reactive metabolite was generated using H2O2. Neutrophils from two patients with a history of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis seemed to be more sensitive to the toxic effects of the clozapine reactive metabolite; however, the numbers are too small to draw any definite conclusions."

Among these reactions, carbonylation has attracted a great deal of attention due to its irreversible and unrepairable nature. Carbonylated proteins are marked for proteolysis by the proteasome and the Lon protease but can escape degradation and form high-molecular-weight aggregates that accumulate with age. Such carbonylated aggregates can become cytotoxic and have been associated with a large number of age-related disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This review focuses on the generation of and defence against protein carbonyls and speculates on the potential role of carbonylation in protein quality control, cellular deterioration, and senescence."

    "abstract": "Hypothesis: This work explores covalent grafting of phenylphosphonate (PPA) onto exfoliated, protonated calcium niobate (HCN), a Dion-Jacobson layered perovskite. The specific hypothesis is that PPA can be readily grafted onto the face surfaces of exfoliated HCN, which has reactive apical oxygen atoms. Experiments: Previous research has established the conditions required for full exfoliation of HCN in aqueous solutions of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), denoted as TBACN. This work first explores the effect of reflux conditions on the dispersion state of TBACN suspensions, and then investigates PPA grafting onto both non-exfoliated HCN and exfoliated TBACN dispersed in deionized (DI) water, TBA solution, and various alcohols. The products are characterized by a variety of techniques including light scattering to assess the TBACN dispersion state, 31P MAS NMR to confirm PPA grafting, and XPS to estimate PPA grafted amounts. Findings: The results confirm the grafting of PPA on HCN and TBACN, quantify the extent of PPA grafting, and identify various grafting modes (mono-, bi-, and tridentate). All of these aspects are found to be dependent on the layered materials' exfoliation state, suspension processing conditions, and solvent composition. The results are rationalized in terms of a plausible mechanism of the grafting process."

    "abstract": "The prevention of autoimmunity requires the elimination of self-reactive T cells during their development and maturation. The expression of diverse self-antigens by stromal cells in the thymus is essential to this process and depends, in part, on the activity of the autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene. Here we report the identification of extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) resident within the secondary lymphoid organs. These stromally derived eTACs express a diverse array of distinct self-antigens and are capable of interacting with and deleting naïve autoreactive T cells. Using two-photon microscopy, we observed stable antigen-specific interactions between eTACs and autoreactive T cells. We propose that such a secondary network of self-antigen-expressing stromal cells may help reinforce immune tolerance by preventing the maturation of autoreactive T cells that escape thymic negative selection."

    "abstract": "The location of and threats to biodiversity are distributed unevenly, so prioritization is essential to minimize biodiversity loss. To address this need, biodiversity conservation organizations have proposed nine templates of global priorities over the past decade. Here, we review the concepts, methods, results, impacts, and challenges of these prioritizations of conservation practice within the theoretical irreplaceability/vulnerability framework of systematic conservation planning. Most of the templates prioritize highly irreplaceable regions; some are reactive (prioritizing high vulnerability), and others are proactive (prioritizing low vulnerability). We hope this synthesis improves understanding of these prioritization approaches and that it results in more efficient allocation of geographically flexible conservation funding."

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role in plant biology acting on the one hand as important signal transduction molecules and on the other as toxic by-products of aerobic metabolism that accumulate in cells during different stress conditions. Because of their toxicity as well as their important signaling role, the level of ROS in cells is tightly controlled by a vast network of genes termed the 'ROS gene network'. Using mutants deficient in key ROS-scavenging enzymes, we have defined a signaling pathway that is activated in cells in response to ROS accumulation. Interestingly, many of the key players in this pathway, including different zinc finger proteins and WRKY transcription factors, are also central regulators of abiotic stress responses involved in temperature, salinity and osmotic stresses. Here, we describe our recent findings and discuss how ROS integrate different signals originating from different cellular compartments during abiotic stress."

    "abstract": "Many important aspects of nanosilver behavior are influenced by the ionic activity associated with the particle suspension, including antibacterial potency, eukaryotic toxicity, environmental release, and particle persistence.The present study synthesizes pure, ion-free, citrate-stabilized nanosilver (nAg) colloids as model systems, and measures their time-dependent release of dissolved silver using centrifugal ultrafiltration and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Ion release is shown to be a cooperative oxidation process requiring both dissolved dioxygen and protons. It produces peroxide intermediates, and proceeds to complete reactive dissolution under some conditions. Ion release rates increase with temperature in the range 0-37 °C, and decrease with increasing pH or addition of humic or fulvic acids. Sea salts have only a minor effect on dissolved silver release. Silver nanoparticle surfaces can adsorb Ag(+), so even simple colloids contain three forms of silver: Ag(0) solids, free Ag(+) or its complexes, and surface-adsorbed Ag(+). Both thermodynamic analysis and kinetic measurements indicate that Ag(0) nanoparticles will not be persistent in realistic environmental compartments containing dissolved oxygen. An empirical kinetic law is proposed that reproduces the observed effects of dissolution time, pH, humic/fulvic acid content, and temperature observed here in the low range of nanosilver concentration most relevant for the environment."

    "abstract": "Objective: To use genetic variants as unconfounded proxies of C reactive protein concentration to study its causal role in coronary heart disease. Design: Mendelian randomisation meta-analysis of individual participant data from 47 epidemiological studies in 15 countries. Participants: 194 418 participants, including 46 557 patients with prevalent or incident coronary heart disease. Information was available on four CRP gene tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3093077, rs1205, rs1130864, rs1800947), concentration of C reactive protein, and levels of other risk factors. Main outcome measures: Risk ratios for coronary heart disease associated with genetically raised C reactive protein versus risk ratios with equivalent differences in C reactive protein concentration itself, adjusted for conventional risk factors and variability in risk factor levels within individuals. Results: CRP variants were each associated with up to 30% per allele difference in concentration of C reactive protein (P < 10 -34 ) and were unrelated to other risk factors. Risk ratios for coronary heart disease per additional copy of an allele associated with raised C reactive protein were 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.00) for rs3093077; 1.00 (0.98 to 1.02) for rs1205; 0.98 (0.96 to 1.00) for rs1130864; and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.03) for rs1800947. In a combined analysis, the risk ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.00 (0.90 to 1.13) per 1 SD higher genetically raised natural log (ln) concentration of C reactive protein. The genetic findings were discordant with the risk ratio observed for coronary heart disease of 1.33 (1.23 to 1.43) per 1 SD higher circulating ln concentration of C reactive protein in prospective studies (P=0.001 for difference). Conclusion: Human genetic data indicate that C reactive protein concentration itself is unlikely to be even a modest causal factor in coronary heart disease."

    "abstract": "Proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components during tissue remodeling plays a pivotal role in normal and pathological processes including wound healing, inflammation, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Proteolytic enzymes in tumors may activate or release growth factors from the ECM or act directly on the ECM itself, thereby facilitating angiogenesis or tumor cell migration. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts found in epithelial cancers and in granulation tissue during wound healing. It is absent from most normal adult human tissues. FAP is conserved throughout chordate evolution, with homologues in mouse and Xenopus laevis, whose expression correlates with tissue remodeling events. Using recombinant and purified natural FAP, we show that FAP has both dipeptidyl peptidase activity and a collagenolytic activity capable of degrading gelatin and type I collagen; by sequence, FAP belongs to the serine protease family rather than the matrix metalloprotease family. Mutation of the putative catalytic serine residue of FAP to alanine abolishes both enzymatic activities. Consistent with its in vivo expression pattern determined by immunohistochemistry, FAP enzyme activity was detected by an immunocapture assay in human cancerous tissues but not in matched normal tissues. This study demonstrates that FAP is present as an active cell surface-bound collagenase in epithelial tumor stroma and opens up investigation into physiological substrates of its novel, tumor-associated dipeptidyl peptidase activity."

    "abstract": "Loading of bioavailable phosphorus, traditionally measured as soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), contributes to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. However, polyphosphates are also bioavailable but escape detection by the standard method used for measuring SRP.  31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometric analysis of sediment extracts and enzymatic assay of surface waters reveal heretofore unreported presence of pyrophosphate (Ppi) in coastal wetlands. We show that the accumulation of Ppi (the smallest chemical form of polyphosphate) in coastal wetlands is related to human impact and can occur in quantities that exceed that of SRP. We further demonstrate that Ppi is readily utilized by microbes in coastal wetland sediments in the presence of nitrogen and carbon and can serve as a reservoir of orthophosphate. Thus, Ppi accumulation in estuaries will subsidize the in situ biogeochemical phosphorus cycle. This has important ecological implications for trophic responses and estuarine productivity."

    "abstract": "Industrial firms increasingly attempt to license their technologies apart from applying them in their own products. Because of the imperfections in technology markets, an active approach towards technology licensing does not automatically result in licensing transactions. To balance prior research, which has focused on licensing transactions as the outcome of licensing intentions, we take a contingency view to analyze how characteristics of a firm's innovation ecosystem determine different strategic types of licensing. Specifically, we distinguish proactive licensing, which refers to identifying recipients for technology transactions, and reactive licensing, which relates to offering licenses to infringers of a firm's intellectual property. Survey data show that environmental antecedents concerning appropriability, i.e., patent protection and technological turbulence, and determinants regarding technology markets, i.e., transaction frequency and competitive intensity, have different effects on proactive and reactive licensing. On this basis, the article has major implications for research into technology licensing, markets for technology, and open innovation."

    "abstract": "In this piece I explore informal learning as an administrative concept; the competing claims of ‘non-formal education’; the significance of tacit knowledge; and the production of social knowledge through distributed and situated learning. I argue that the most useful way of exploring and developing what is a fundamental area of human endeavour, is to put ‘informal learning’ on one side for the moment and to focus on: * learning in its various guises – implicit, reactive and deliberative, for example, and * self-directed and communal forms of education. The idea of ‘informal education’, I suggest, does have utility."

    "abstract": "Many modern games provide environments in which agents perform decision making at several levels of granularity. In the domain of real-time strategy games, an effective agent must make high-level strategic decisions while simultaneously controlling individual units in battle. We advocate reactive planning as a powerful technique for building multi-scale game AI and demonstrate that it enables the specification of complex, real-time agents in a unified agent architecture. We present several idioms used to enable authoring of an agent that concurrently pursues strategic and tactical goals, and an agent for playing the real-time strategy game StarCraft that uses these design patterns."

The approach is applied to the problem of reactive navigation for nonholonomic mobile robots in highly cluttered environments. This is a collision-free initial path being given for a robot, and obstacles detected while following this path can make it in collision. The current path is iteratively deformed in order to get away from obstacles and satisfy the nonholonomic constraints. The core idea of the approach is to perturb the input functions of the system along the current path in order to modify this path, making an optimization criterion decrease."

    "abstract": "This article provides a synthesis of literature values to trace the fate of 150 Tg/yr anthropogenic nitrogen applied by humans to the Earth's land surface. Approximately 9 TgN/yr may be accumulating in the terrestrial biosphere in pools with residence times of ten to several hundred years. Enhanced fluvial transport of nitrogen in rivers and percolation to groundwater accounts for approximately 35 and 15 TgN/yr, respectively. Greater denitrification in terrestrial soils and wetlands may account for the loss of approximately 17 TgN/yr from the land surface, calculated by a compilation of data on the fraction of N(2)O emitted to the atmosphere and the current global rise of this gas in the atmosphere. A recent estimate of atmospheric transport of reactive nitrogen from land to sea (NO(x) and NH(x)) accounts for 48 TgN/yr. The total of these enhanced sinks, 124 TgN/yr, is less than the human-enhanced inputs to the land surface, indicating areas of needed additional attention to global nitrogen biogeochemistry. Policy makers should focus on increasing nitrogen-use efficiency in fertilization, reducing transport of reactive N to rivers and groundwater, and maximizing denitrification to its N(2) endproduct."

    "abstract": "26 Diverse crop rotations, cover crops and the possibility of integrating livestock make organic 27 systems potentially more sustainable than other agroecosystems. Lower reactive nitrogen (N) in 28 organic systems minimizes the potential for N losses. However, addition of organic manures and 29 residues containing mineralizable N and carbon (C) have the potential to enhance nitrous oxide 30 (N 2 O) emissions. We conducted a 39 d laboratory incubation to assess key microbiological 31 drivers controlling nitrification and denitrification in long-term organic agroecosystems during 32 simulated freeze-thaw cycles. Soils were collected from two annual organic vegetable systems 33 receiving 1) mixed-compost, or 2) broiler litter and 3) an organic perennial pasture system 34 cropped to vegetables every third year. Soil microcosms amended with 15 N labelled sugar beet 35 residue or unamended were maintained at 40, 60 and 80% of water filled pore space (WFPS). 36 Significant N 2 O was emitted (4287-6138 µg kg-1 soil) via denitrification from amended soil 37 microcosms at 3 °C and 80% WFPS. Archaeal (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) nitrifier amoA gene 38 copies were affected by temperature and reactive N species during freeze-thaws. Long-term 39 organic vegetable cropping systems receiving mixed-compost additions had the potential to 40 accumulate C and immobilize excess reactive soil N (particularly nitrates) thereby improving soil 41 health and reducing N 2 O emissions. 42"

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest developmental influences may feed into components of the disorder separately from associated disruptive behavior problems. We investigated this in terms of key personality/temperament traits of Reactive and Effortful Control, Resiliency, and Emotionality. METHODS: A sample of 179 children (age 6-12, 63% boys), of whom 92 had ADHD, 52 were Controls, and 35 were borderline or not otherwise specified cases of ADHD, were examined. Dispositional trait scores were derived from parent-completed California Q-sort and the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire. Child ADHD symptoms were evaluated using maternal structured diagnostic interview and teacher-completed symptom ratings. RESULTS: Traits were differentially associated with symptoms. Reactive Control was related to hyperactivity-impulsivity as rated by both parents and teachers. Negative Emotionality was related to oppositional-defiance. Resiliency was primarily related to inattention-disorganization as rated by both parents and teachers; Effortful Control was related uniquely to inattention in parent but not teacher data. A moderation effect emerged; the relationship between parent-rated Negative Emotionality and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms was stronger for children with high levels of both Reactive and Effortful Control. CONCLUSIONS: Results are interpreted in relation to a two-pathway model of ADHD; regulation problems contribute to the emergence of symptoms of inattention-disorganization, reactive or motivational control problems to the emergence of hyperactivity-impulsivity, and these are distinct from negative affectivity. Children with regulation deficits and a reactive motivational style are especially at risk for the development of ADHD."

    "abstract": "Aims Reactive oxygen species are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, yet the use of antioxidants in clinical trials has been ineffective at improving outcomes. In endothelial cells, high-dextrose-induced oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress promote endothelial dysfunction leading to the recruitment and activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and the breakdown of barrier function. Ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) mimic, has been shown to improve ??-cell function in diabetes and prevent atherosclerosis. Main methods To determine if ebselen inhibits both oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in endothelial cells, we examined its effects in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) with and without high-dextrose. Oxidative stress and ER stress were measured by 2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-A]pyrazin-3-one hydrochloride chemiluminescence and ER stress alkaline phosphatase assays, respectively. GPX1 over-expression and knockdown were performed by transfecting cells with a GPX1 expression construct or a GPX1-specific siRNA, respectively. Key findings Ebselen inhibited dextrose-induced oxidative stress but not ER stress in both HUVEC and HCAEC. Ebselen also had no effect on tunicamycin-induced ER stress in HCAEC. Furthermore, augmentation of GPX1 activity directly by sodium selenite supplementation or transfection of a GPX1 expression plasmid decreased dextrose-induced oxidative stress but not ER stress, while GPX1 knockout enhanced oxidative stress but had no effect on ER stress. Significance These results suggest that ebselen targets only oxidative stress but not ER stress."

The direct acid/base flux to the ocean is predominately acidic (reducing total alkalinity) in the temperate Northern Hemisphere and alkaline in the tropics because of ammonia inputs. However, because most of the excess ammonia is nitrified to nitrate (NO(3)(-)) in the upper ocean, the effective net atmospheric input is acidic almost everywhere. The decrease in surface alkalinity drives a net air-sea efflux of CO(2), reducing surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); the alkalinity and DIC changes mostly offset each other, and the decline in surface pH is small. Additional impacts arise from nitrogen fertilization, leading to elevated primary production and biological DIC drawdown that reverses in some places the sign of the surface pH and air-sea CO(2) flux perturbations. On a global scale, the alterations in surface water chemistry from anthropogenic nitrogen and sulfur deposition are a few percent of the acidification and DIC increases due to the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO(2). However, the impacts are more substantial in coastal waters, where the ecosystem responses to ocean acidification could have the most severe implications for mankind."

    "abstract": "Phagocytes mediate their innate immunological response by releasing products that damage invading microorganisms. These products include proteins such as lysozyme, peroxidases, and elastase as well as reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hypohalous acid, and hydroxyl radical. Although it is clear that many phagocytic secretory products have direct cytotoxic potential, understanding is limited of how multiple products interact to generate and modulate the cytotoxic response. This review focuses on recent findings that elucidate the biochemical nature of secretory product interaction in the formation of free radicals, particularly the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. The possible role of these reactions in phagocyte microbicidal activity and inflammatory tissue injury is discussed."

    "abstract": "Reactive behavior is rapidly becoming a key feature of modern software systems in such diverse areas as ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems, and event-based supply chain management. In this paper we analyze the convergence of techniques from aspect oriented programming, active databases and asynchronous notification systems to form reactive middleware. We identify the common core of abstractions and explain both commonalities and differences to start a dialogue across community boundaries. We present existing options for implementation of reactive software and analyze their run-time semantics. We do not advocate a particular approach but concentrate on identifying how the various disciplines can benefit from each other. We believe that AOP can solve the impedance mismatch found in reactive systems that are implemented through inherently static languages, while AOP can benefit from the active database community's experience with event detection/composition and fault tolerance in large scale systems. The result could be a solid foundation for the realization of reactive middleware services."

    "abstract": "The potential eco-toxicity of nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), silicon dioxide (SiO(2)), and zinc oxide (ZnO) water suspensions was investigated using Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli as test organisms. These three photosensitive nanomaterials were harmful to varying degrees, with antibacterial activity increasing with particle concentration. Antibacterial activity generally increased from SiO(2) to TiO(2) to ZnO, and B. subtilis was most susceptible to their effects. Advertised nanoparticle size did not correspond to true particle size. Apparently, aggregation produced similarly sized particles that had similar antibacterial activity at a given concentration. The presence of light was a significant factor under most conditions tested, presumably due to its role in promoting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, bacterial growth inhibition was also observed under dark conditions, indicating that undetermined mechanisms additional to photocatalytic ROS production were responsible for toxicity. These results highlight the need for caution during the use and disposal of such manufactured nanomaterials to prevent unintended environmental impacts, as well as the importance of further research on the mechanisms and factors that increase toxicity to enhance risk management."

Prior to formation of the ELR-CFCGs, azide-bearing and cyclooctyne-modified ELRs were also synthesized. Subsequent covalent crosslinking was based on the reaction between these azide and cyclooctyne groups, which takes place under physiological conditions and without the need for a catalyst. The correlation among SEM micrographs, porosity, swelling ratio, and rheological measurements have been carried out. The storage and loss moduli at 1 Hz are in the range 1-10 kPa and 100-1000 Pa, respectively. The linear dependence of - on f12 and the peak value of tan ?? were considered to be consistent with a poroelastic mechanism dominating the frequency range 0.3-70 Hz. The discrete relaxation spectrum was obtained from stress relaxation measurements (t > 5 s). The good fit of the relaxation modulus to decrease exponential functions suggests that an intrinsic viscoelastic mechanism dominates the transients. Several recombinamer concentrations and temperatures were tested to obtain gels with fully tuneable properties that could find applications in the biomedical field. ?? 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

    "abstract": "Furan derivatives obtained from renewable biomass resources have the potential to serve as substitutes for the petroleum-based building blocks that are currently used in the production of plastics and fine chemicals. We developed a process for the selective dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) that operates at high fructose concentrations (10 to 50 weight %), achieves high yields (80% HMF selectivity at 90% fructose conversion), and delivers HMF in a separation-friendly solvent. In a two-phase reactor system, fructose is dehydrated in the aqueous phase with the use of an acid catalyst (hydrochloric acid or an acidic ion-exchange resin) with dimethylsulfoxide and/or poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone) added to suppress undesired side reactions. The HMF product is continuously extracted into an organic phase (methylisobutylketone) modified with 2-butanol to enhance partitioning from the reactive aqueous solution."

Toxic and mutagenic consequences are minimized by distinct pathways of repair, and 130 known human DNA repair genes are described here. Notable features presently include four enzymes that can remove uracil from DNA, seven recombination genes related to RAD51, and many recently discovered DNA polymerases that bypass damage, but only one system to remove the main DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet light. More human DNA repair genes will be found by comparison with model organisms and as common folds in three-dimensional protein structures are determined. Modulation of DNA repair should lead to clinical applications including improvement of radiotherapy and treatment with anticancer drugs and an advanced understanding of the cellular aging process."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare psychophysiological and cortisol reactions to psychological stress in older depressed and nondepressed patients at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Forty-eight depressed participants and 20 controls with elevated cardiovascular risk factors underwent a psychological stress test during which cardiovascular variables were measured. Salivary cortisol was collected after each test segment. Traditional (e.g., lipids) and atypical (e.g., C-reactive protein) CVD risk factors were also obtained. RESULTS: At baseline, the groups did not differ on lipid levels, flow-mediated vasodilation, body mass index, or asymmetric dimethylarginine. However, the depressed patients had significantly higher C-reactive protein levels. Contrary to our hypothesis, there were no differences in baseline cortisol levels or diurnal cortisol slopes, but depressed patients showed significantly lower cortisol levels during the stress test (p = .03) and less cortisol response to stress. Compared with nondepressed subjects, depressed subjects also showed lower levels of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA(TF)) during the stress test (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, older depressed subjects with elevated risk for CVD exhibited a hypocortisol response to acute stress. This impaired cortisol response might contribute to chronic inflammation (as reflected in the elevated C-reactive proteins in depressed patients) and in other ways increase CVD risk. The reduced RSA(TF) activity may also increase CVD risk in depressed patients through impaired autonomic nervous system response to cardiophysiological demands."

In addition, these reactive oxygen species can influence the ageing process through mechanisms involving mutagenesis of mtDNA or increased rates of shortening of telomeric DNA."

SWTI is a single polypeptide chain protein and it's structure has 174 amino acid residues, it homologous to other Kunitz plant inhibitors, however shows some major differences: it contains only one disulfide bridge, instead two which are usually found in plant Kunitz inhibitors, and the SWTI reactive site does not contain the usual Arg or Lys residues at the putative reactive site (position 65). A glycosylation site was detected at Asn38 with 1188 kDa carbohydrate portion. The primary structure micro heterogeneity was found combining the sequence determination and mass spectrometry. Three forms of SWTI were actually defined: two glycosylated forms a 20,204 kDa (Arg 165) and 20,185 kDa (His 165) and one deglycosylated form 19,016 kDa (Arg 165), all of them contain a Met residue at position 130."

    "abstract": "The production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) by mammalian mitochondria is important because it underlies oxidative damage in many pathologies and contributes to retrograde redox signalling from the organelle to the cytosol and nucleus. Superoxide (O2(*-)) is the proximal mitochondrial ROS, and in the present review I outline the principles that govern O2(*-) production within the matrix of mammalian mitochondria. The flux of O2(*-) is related to the concentration of potential electron donors, the local concentration of O2 and the second-order rate constants for the reactions between them. Two modes of operation by isolated mitochondria result in significant O2(*-) production, predominantly from complex I: (i) when the mitochondria are not making ATP and consequently have a high Deltap (protonmotive force) and a reduced CoQ (coenzyme Q) pool; and (ii) when there is a high NADH/NAD+ ratio in the mitochondrial matrix. For mitochondria that are actively making ATP, and consequently have a lower Deltap and NADH/NAD+ ratio, the extent of O2(*-) production is far lower. The generation of O2(*-) within the mitochondrial matrix depends critically on Deltap, the NADH/NAD+ and CoQH2/CoQ ratios and the local O2 concentration, which are all highly variable and difficult to measure in vivo. Consequently, it is not possible to estimate O2(*-) generation by mitochondria in vivo from O2(*-)-production rates by isolated mitochondria, and such extrapolations in the literature are misleading. Even so, the description outlined here facilitates the understanding of factors that favour mitochondrial ROS production. There is a clear need to develop better methods to measure mitochondrial O2(*-) and H2O2 formation in vivo, as uncertainty about these values hampers studies on the role of mitochondrial ROS in pathological oxidative damage and redox signalling."

Particle size was characterized using DLS and OM, and thermal stability and Tg were assessed using TGA and DSC. PMBs produced from higher functionality monomers produce smaller particles, and Tg increased with monomer rigidity. TTT-PETMP PMBs were derivatized with C60 to demonstrate the accessibility and reactivity of the residual thiols, successful inclusion of C60 as the reactive ene moiety, and overall PMB utility as a scaffold material. Upon capping with C60, the Tg of the composite particles increased significantly. Most importantly, the C60-capped PMBs produced singlet oxygen in direct and indirect chemical assays, and the efficiency did not decrease after recycling."

    "abstract": "Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), which is composed of four multiprotein complexes named complex I-IV, is believed to be important in the aging process and in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Previous studies have identified the ubiquinone of complex III and an unknown component of complex I as the major sites of ROS generation. Here we show that the physiologically relevant ROS generation supported by the complex II substrate succinate occurs at the flavin mononucleotide group (FMN) of complex I through reversed electron transfer, not at the ubiquinone of complex III as commonly believed. Indirect evidence indicates that the unknown ROS-generating site within complex I is also likely to be the FMN group. It is therefore suggested that the major physiologically and pathologically relevant ROS-generating site in mitochondria is limited to the FMN group of complex I. These new insights clarify an elusive target for intervening mitochondrial ROS-related processes or diseases."

Currently there are many unresolved questions concerning the relationship between apoptosis and the generation of ROS. These include which ROS are involved in apoptosis, what mechanisms and targets are important and whether apoptosis is triggered by ROS damage or ROS are generated as a consequence or part of the cellular disruption that occurs during cell death. Here we review the nature of the ROS involved, the damage they cause to cells, summarise the responses of S. cerevisiae to ROS and discuss those aspects in which ROS affect cell integrity that may be relevant to the apoptotic process."

This article summarizes the lessons learned from a project based on the participatory integration of qualitative local stakeholders' knowledge with expert GIS fire simulations carried out in the County of El Bages, Catalonia, Spain. First, in this article, a theoretical model--the forest fire circle--is presented in order to explain the reasons for the rise in the damage and frequency of forest fires in this Mediterranean area. Second, it describes the methodology developed and the stages followed during the project. Results show that: (1) the advocacy of old forest reactive management paradigm assumptions and practices based on uncontrolled forest succession can put vast wooded areas of the Mediterranean basin at critical risk; and (2) forest fire management approaches that ignore the crucial role of long-term prevention and local capacity building strategies have failed. In the final section, the content and the specific dimensions of the old reactive paradigm that has characterized forest fire risk management in Catalonia are discussed and contrasted with the possibly emerging preventative paradigm."

Because violent offenders often have a history of both instrumental and reactive aggression, this study distinguished between offenders with a history of at least 1 instrumental violent offense and offenders with a history of reactive violent offenses. Two studies tested the hypothesis that instrumental offenders would score higher than reactive offenders and nonviolent offenders on R. D. Hare's (1991) Psychopathy Checklist. The first study sample consisted of 106 violent and nonviolent offenders recruited from a medium-security correctional facility. The second study sample consisted of 50 violent offenders referred for pretrial forensic evaluation. In both samples, instrumental offenders could be reliably distinguished from reactive offenders on the basis of violent crime behavior and level of psychopathy. Group differences could not be attributed to participant age, race, length of incarceration, or extent of prior criminal record."

    "abstract": "To consistently improve software quality management, greater automation and tighter integration of quality tools and measurements in the software engineering environment is essential. However, automation of software quality management faces numerous challenges such as project uniqueness, project dynamics, efficiency, and limited time and quality expenditures. In this paper, an approach is proposed that extends the Goal-Question-Metric technique and automates the monitoring of quality goals via a multi-agent system by using competitive bidding agent behavior for proactive vs. cooperative voting for reactive measures. The preliminary results show promise for systematically harmonizing (conflicting) quality attributes, goals, metrics, and countermeasures and for automating aspects of software quality management."

In a northern Michigan forest, the direct measurement of total OH reactivity, which is the inverse of the OH lifetime, was significantly greater than expected. The difference between measured and expected OH reactivity, called the missing OH reactivity, increased with temperature, as did emission rates for terpenes and other BVOCs. These measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that unknown reactive BVOCs, perhaps terpenes, provide the missing OH reactivity."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary theory is firmly grounded on the existence of trade-offs between life-history traits, and recent interest has centred on the physiological mechanisms underlying such trade-offs. Several branches of evolutionary biology, particularly those focusing on ageing, immunological and sexual selection theory, have implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as profound evolutionary players. ROS are a highly reactive group of oxygen-containing molecules, generated as common by-products of vital oxidative enzyme complexes. Both animals and plants appear to intentionally harness ROS for use as molecular messengers to fulfil a wide range of essential biological processes. However, at high levels, ROS are known to exert very damaging effects through oxidative stress. For these reasons, ROS have been suggested to be important mediators of the cost of reproduction, and of trade-offs between metabolic rate and lifespan, and between immunity, sexual ornamentation and sperm quality. In this review, we integrate the above suggestions into one life-history framework, and review the evidence in support of the contention that ROS production will constitute a primary and universal constraint in life-history evolution."

J Strength Cond Res 22(5): 1413-1415, 2008-In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of two different dynamic warm-up conditions, one that was inclusive of open skills (i.e., reactive movements) and one that included only preplanned dynamic activities (i.e., closed skills) on the performance of speed, change of direction speed, vertical jump, and reactive agility in team sport athletes. Fourteen (six male, eight female) junior (mean ± SD age, 16.3 ± 0.7 year) basketball players participated in this study. Testing was conducted on 2 separate days using a within-subjects crossover study design. Each athlete performed a standardized 7-minute warm-up consisting of general dynamic movements and stretching. After the general warm-up, athletes were randomly allocated into one of two groups that performed a dynamic 15-minute warm-up consisting entirely of open or closed skills. Each of the warm-up conditions consisted of five activities of 3 minute duration. At the completion of the warm-up protocol, players completed assessments of reactive agility, speed (5-, 10-, and 20-msprints), change of direction speed (T-test), and vertical jump. No significant differences (p  > 0.05) were detected among warm-up conditions for speed, vertical jump, change of direction speed, and reactive agility performances. The results of this study demonstrate that either open skill or closed skill warm-ups can be used effectively for team sport athletes without compromising performance on open skill and closed skill tasks. © 2008 National Strength and Conditioning Association."

Genetic tools are now enabling the molecular dissection of the functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in vivo. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that reactive astrogliosis can exert both beneficial and detrimental effects in a context-dependent manner determined by specific molecular signaling cascades. Reactive astrocytes can have both loss of normal functions and gain of abnormal effects that could feature prominently in a variety of disease processes. This article reviews developments in the signaling mechanisms that regulate specific aspects of reactive astrogliosis and highlights the potential to identify novel therapeutic molecular targets for diverse neurological disorders."

Oxygen is vital for life but is also potentially dangerous, and a complex system of checks and balances exists for utilizing this essential element. Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance in pro-oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis that leads to the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species. The systems in place to cope with the biochemistry of oxygen are complex, and many questions about the mechanisms of oxygen regulation remain unanswered. However, this same complexity provides a number of therapeutic targets, and different strategies, including novel metal-protein attenuating compounds, aimed at a variety of targets have shown promise in clinical studies."

    "abstract": "The anticancer agent Adriamycin (ADR) has long been recognized to induce a dose-limiting cardiotoxicity. Numerous studies have attempted to characterize and elucidate the mechanism(s) behind its cardiotoxic effect. Despite a wealth of data covering a wide-range of effects mediated by the drug, the definitive mechanism remains a matter of debate. However, there is consensus that this toxicity is related to the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Induction of ROS in the heart by ADR occurs via redox cycling of the drug at complex I of the electron transport chain. Many studies support the theory that mitochondria are a primary target of ADR-induced oxidative stress, both acutely and long-term. This review focuses on the effects of ADR redox cycling on the mitochondrion, which support the hypothesis that these organelles are indeed a major factor in ADR cardiotoxicity. This review has been constructed with particular emphasis on studies utilizing cardiac models with clinically relevant doses or concentrations of ADR in the hope of advancing our understanding of the mechanisms of ADR toxicity. This compilation of current data may reveal valuable insights for the development of therapeutic strategies better tailored to minimizing the dose-limiting effect of ADR."

    "abstract": "This paper describes a fabrication technique for building three-dimensional (3-D) micro-channels in polydimethyl- siloxane (PDMS) elastomer. The process allows for the stacking of many thin (less than 100- m thick) patterned PDMS layers to realize complex 3-D channel paths. The master for each layer is formed on a silicon wafer using an epoxy-based photoresist (SU 8). PDMS is cast against the master producing molded layers containing channels and openings. To realize thin layers with openings, a sandwich molding configuration was developed that allows precise control of the PDMS thickness. The master wafer is clamped within a sandwich that includes flat aluminum plates, a flexible polyester film layer, a rigid Pyrex wafer, and a rubber sheet. A parametric study is performed on PDMS surface activation in a reactive-ion-etching system and the subsequent methanol treatment for bonding and aligning very thin individual components to a substrate. Low RF power and short treatment times are better than high RF power and long treatment times, respectively, for instant bonding. Layer-to-layer alignment of less then 15 m is achieved with manual alignment techniques that utilize surface tension driven self-alignment methods. A coring procedure is used to realize off-chip fluidic connections via the bottom PDMS layer, allowing the top layer to remain smooth and flat for complete optical access. [444]"

    "abstract": "© 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.Alumina-aluminium titanate composite was fabricated through paste extrusion using boehmite gel as a binder. The rheological characteristics of alumina paste containing various amounts of boehmite binder were studied at different shear rates. The results of investigations on the development of torque, yield stress, viscosity and fluidity are presented. In general, Bingham type plastic behavior was observed. Alumina pastes containing 18.5 vol.% of boehmite exhibits adequate plasticity and fluidity for extrusion. The torque value for this composition is 68 kPa at shear rate 28.5 s-1. The viscosity curves of alumina pastes showed \"shear thinning\" flow behavior. The mixture of 54.15 vol.% alumina and 18.5 vol.% boehmite resulted in 61% of theoretical green density on extrusion. These conditions were extended to synthesis of alumina-aluminium titanate composites, and the extrusion was carried out using 18.5 vol.% boehmite. Aluminium titanate was synthesized through sol-gel method and dispersed uniformly in alumina matrix through colloidal process. The composites could be sintered at 1400°C to 98% of its theoretical value. The SEM fractograph of sintered composite showed reasonably dense, uniformly distributed grains in the order of 2-3 μm. The present study shows that boehmite binder phase yields good workability for extrusion and contributes high green and sintered densities to the composites."

    "abstract": "Copyright © ERS 2017. It is uncertain whether phenotypes of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) vary between populations with different genetic and environmental characteristics. Here, our objective was to compare the phenotypes of airways disease in two separate populations. This was a cross-sectional observational study in adult populations from New Zealand and China. Participants aged 40-75 years who reported wheeze and breathlessness in the last 12 months were randomly selected from the general population and underwent detailed characterisation. Complete data for cluster analysis were available for 345 participants. Hierarchical cluster analysis was undertaken, based on 12 variables: forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio, bronchodilator reversibility, peak expiratory flow variability, transfer coefficient of the lung for carbon monoxide, exhaled nitric oxide fraction, total IgE, C-reactive protein, age of symptom onset, body mass index, health status and cigarette smoke exposure. Cluster analysis of the combined dataset described five phenotypes: \"severe late-onset asthma/COPD overlap group\", \"moderately severe early-onset asthma/COPD overlap group\", \"moderate to severe asthma group with type 2 predominant disease\", and two groups with minimal airflow obstruction, differentiated by age of onset. Separate analyses by country showed similar patterns; however, a distinct obese/comorbid group was observed in the New Zealand population. Cluster analysis of adults with symptomatic airways disease suggests the presence of similar asthma/COPD overlap phenotypes within populations with different genetic and environmental characteristics, and an obese/comorbid phenotype in a Western population."

It was characterized as a Japanese encephalitis and West Nile virus cross-reactive arbovirus by complement fixation test. A plaque reduction-neutralization test was performed using hyperimmune sera raised against the plaque-purified arbovirus isolate. The sera did not show reactivity with Japanese encephalitis virus and were weakly reactive with West Nile virus. Complete open reading frame sequence analysis characterized the arbovirus as Bagaza virus (BAGV), with 94.80 % nucleotide identity with African BAGV strain DakAr B209. Sera collected from the encephalitic patients during the acute phase of illness showed 15 % (8/53) positivity for anti-BAGV neutralizing antibodies. This is the first report of the isolation of BAGV from India. The presence of anti-BAGV neutralizing antibodies suggests that the human population has been exposed to BAGV."

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical studies indicate that reactive organic iodocarbons such as CH2I2 would be extremely effective agents for tropospheric Arctic ozone depletion and that iodine compounds added to a Br2/BrCl mixture have a significantly greater ozone (and mercury) depletion effect than additional Br2 and BrCl molecules. Here we report the first observations of CH2I2, CH2IBr, and CH2ICl in Arctic air, as well as other reactive halocarbons including CHBr3, during spring at Kuujjuarapik, Hudson Bay. The organoiodine compounds were present atthe highest levels yet reported in air. The occurrence of the halocarbons was associated with northwesterly winds from the frozen bay, and, in the case of CHBr3, was anticorrelated with ozone and total gaseous mercury (TGM), suggesting a link between inorganic and organic halogens. The absence of local leads coupled with the extremely short atmospheric lifetime of CH2I2 indicates that production occurred in the surface of the sea-ice/overlying snowpack over the bay. We propose an abiotic mechanism for the production of polyhalogenated iodo- and bromocarbons, via reaction of HOI and/or HOBr with organic material on the quasi-liquid layer above sea-ice/snowpack, and report laboratory data to support this mechanism. CH2I2, CH2IBr, and other organic iodine compounds may therefore be a ubiquitous component of air above sea ice where they will increase the efficiency of bromine-initiated ozone and mercury depletion."

    "abstract": "The transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a major role in coordinating innate and adaptative immunity, cellular proliferation, apoptosis and development. Since the discovery in 1991 that NF-kappaB may be activated by H(2)O(2), several laboratories have put a considerable effort into dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying this activation. Whereas early studies revealed an atypical mechanism of activation, leading to IkappaBalpha Y42 phosphorylation independently of IkappaB kinase (IKK), recent findings suggest that H(2)O(2) activates NF-kappaB mainly through the classical IKK-dependent pathway. The molecular mechanisms leading to IKK activation are, however, cell-type specific and will be presented here. In this review, we also describe the effect of other ROS (HOCl and (1)O(2)) and reactive nitrogen species on NF-kappaB activation. Finally, we critically review the recent data highlighting the role of ROS in NF-kappaB activation by proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), two major components of innate immunity."

The identification of sensitive and reliable markers of disease severity is fundamental to improving patient care. An intense pro-inflammatory response with oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species is present in malaria. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and antioxidant agents such as superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) are likely candidate biomarkers for disease severity. Here we tested whether plasma levels of SOD-1 could serve as a biomarker of severe vivax malaria."

When CRP was determined by the latex agglutination method, RF caused both increased titers for CRP and false positive reactions for CRP. These effects of RF were abrogated by pretreatment of test samples with 2-mercaptoethanol. Detection of CRP by radial immunodiffusion was not affected by RF. Therefore, the clinical relevance of CRP detected in RF positive sera by latex agglutination can be ascertained only following pretreatment of sera with 2-mercaptoethanol or by the use of radial immunodiffusion to circumvent interference by RF."

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are a class of secondary plant phenolics with significant antioxidant and chelating properties. In the human diet, they are most concentrated in fruits, vegetables, wines, teas and cocoa. Their cardioprotective effects stem from the ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation, chelate redox-active metals, and attenuate other processes involving reactive oxygen species. Flavonoids occur in foods primarily as glycosides and polymers that are degraded to variable extents in the digestive tract. Although metabolism of these compounds remains elusive, enteric absorption occurs sufficiently to reduce plasma indices of oxidant status. The propensity of a flavonoid to inhibit free-radical mediated events is governed by its chemical structure. Since these compounds are based on the flavan nucleus, the number, positions, and types of substitutions influence radical scavenging and chelating activity. The diversity and multiple mechanisms of flavonoid action, together with the numerous methods of initiation, detection and measurement of oxidative processes in vitro and in vivo offer plausible explanations for existing discrepancies in structure-activity relationships. Despite some inconsistent lines of evidence, several structure-activity relationships are well established in vitro. Multiple hydroxyl groups confer upon the molecule substantial antioxidant, chelating and prooxidant activity. Methoxy groups introduce unfavorable steric effects and increase lipophilicity and membrane partitioning. A double bond and carbonyl function in the heterocycle or polymerization of the nuclear structure increases activity by affording a more stable flavonoid radical through conjugation and electron delocalization. Further investigation of the metabolism of these phytochemicals is justified to extend structure-activity relationships (SAR) to preventive and therapeutic nutritional strategies."

    "abstract": "Developments in nanotechnology are leading to a rapid proliferation of new materials that are likely to become a source of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) to the environment, where their possible ecotoxicological impacts remain unknown. The surface properties of ENPs are of essential importance for their aggregation behavior, and thus for their mobility in aquatic and terrestrial systems and for their interactions with algae, plants and, fungi. Interactions of ENPs with natural organic matter have to be considered as well, as those will alter the ENPs aggregation behavior in surface waters or in soils. Cells of plants, algae, and fungi possess cell walls that constitute a primary site for interaction and a barrier for the entrance of ENPs. Mechanisms allowing ENPs to pass through cell walls and membranes are as yet poorly understood. Inside cells, ENPs might directly provoke alterations of membranes and other cell structures and molecules, as well as protective mechanisms. Indirect effects of ENPs depend on their chemical and physical properties and may include physical restraints (clogging effects), solubilization of toxic ENP compounds, or production of reactive oxygen species. Many questions regarding the bioavailability of ENPs, their uptake by algae, plants, and fungi and the toxicity mechanisms remain to be elucidated."

These components run as separate computational processes. This is most easily accomplished by using a multi-tasking or multithreaded operating system, but can also be done my carefully coding the algorithms so they can be manually interleaved within a single computational process. In 3T the components are called the skill layer, the sequencing layer, and the planning layer respectively. In ATLANTIS these layers are called the controller, the sequencer, and the deliberator. The following discussion uses the ATLANTIS terminology, but as much as possible the description is generic to all incarnations of the ..."

    "abstract": "The non-specific host response to implanted biomaterials is often a key challenge of medical device design. To evaluate biocompatibility, measuring the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by inflammatory cells in response to biomaterial surfaces is a well-established method. However, the detection of ROS in response to materials implanted in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we develop a bioluminescence whole animal imaging approach to observe ROS released in response to subcutaneously-implanted materials in live animals. We compared the real-time generation of ROS in response to two representative materials, polystyrene and alginate, over the course of 28 days. High levels of ROS were observed near polystyrene, but not alginate implants, and persisted throughout the course of 28 days. Histological analysis revealed that high levels of ROS correlated not only with the presence of phagocytic cells at early timepoints, but also fibrosis at later timepoints, suggesting that ROS may be involved in both the acute and chronic phase of the foreign body response. These data are the first in vivo demonstration of ROS generation in response to implanted materials, and describe a novel technique to evaluate the host response."

    "abstract": "Two types of silicon carbide (SiC) synthesized using two different vapor deposition processes were embedded in UO2 pellets and evaluated for their potential chemical reaction with UO2. While minor reactivity between chemical-vapor-composited (CVC) SiC and UO2 was observed at comparatively low temperatures of 1100 and 1300??C, chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) SiC did not show any such reactivity. However, both CVD and CVC SiCs showed some reaction with UO2 at a higher temperature (1500??C). Elemental maps supported by phase maps obtained using electron backscatter diffraction indicated that CVC SiC was more reactive than CVD SiC at 1500??C. Furthermore, this investigation indicated the formation of uranium carbides and uranium silicide chemical phases such as UC, USi2, and U3Si2 as a result of SiC reaction with UO2."

    "abstract": "Plant secondary metabolites are unique sources for pharmaceuticals, food additives, flavors, and other industrial materials. Accumulation of such metabolites often occurs in plants subjected to stresses including various elicitors or signal molecules. Understanding signal transduction paths underlying elicitor-induced production of secondary metabolites is important for optimizing their commercial production. This paper summarizes progress made on several aspects of elicitor signal transduction leading to production of plant secondary metabolites, including: elicitor signal perception by various receptors of plants; avirulence determinants and corresponding plant R proteins; heterotrimeric and small GTP binding proteins; ion fluxes, especially Ca2+ influx, and Ca2+ signaling; medium alkalinization and cytoplasmic acidification; oxidative burst and reactive oxygen species; inositol trisphosphates and cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP); salicylic acid and nitric oxide; jasmonate, ethylene, and abscisic acid signaling; oxylipin signals such as allene oxide synthase-dependent jasmonate and hydroperoxide lyase-dependent C12 and C6 volatiles; as well as other lipid messengers such as lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol. All these signal components are employed directly or indirectly by elicitors for induction of plant secondary metabolite accumulation. Cross-talk between different signaling pathways is very common in plant defense response, thus the cross-talk amongst these signaling pathways, such as elicitor and jasmonate, jasmonate and ethylene, and each of these with reactive oxygen species, is discussed separately. This review also highlights the integration of multiple signaling pathways into or by transcription factors, as well as the linkage of the above signal components in elicitor signaling network through protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Some perspectives on elicitor signal transduction and plant secondary metabolism at the transcriptome and metabolome levels are also presented."

    "abstract": "Adoptive transfer of large numbers of tumor-reactive CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) expanded and differentiated in vitro has shown promising clinical activity against cancer. However, such protocols are complicated by extensive ex vivo manipulations of tumor-reactive cells and have largely focused on CD8(+) CTLs, with much less emphasis on the role and contribution of CD4(+) T cells. Using a mouse model of advanced melanoma, we found that transfer of small numbers of naive tumor-reactive CD4(+) T cells into lymphopenic recipients induces substantial T cell expansion, differentiation, and regression of large established tumors without the need for in vitro manipulation. Surprisingly, CD4(+) T cells developed cytotoxic activity, and tumor rejection was dependent on class II-restricted recognition of tumors by tumor-reactive CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, blockade of the coinhibitory receptor CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on the transferred CD4(+) T cells resulted in greater expansion of effector T cells, diminished accumulation of tumor-reactive regulatory T cells, and superior antitumor activity capable of inducing regression of spontaneous mouse melanoma. These findings suggest a novel potential therapeutic role for cytotoxic CD4(+) T cells and CTLA-4 blockade in cancer immunotherapy, and demonstrate the potential advantages of differentiating tumor-reactive CD4(+) cells in vivo over current protocols favoring in vitro expansion and differentiation."

    "abstract": "Major rivers worldwide have experienced dramatic changes in flow, reducing their natural ability to adjust to and absorb disturbances. Given expected changes in global climate and water needs, this may create serious problems, including loss of native biodiversity and risks to ecosystems and humans from increased flooding or water shortages. Here, we project river discharge under different climate and water withdrawal scenarios and combine this with data on the impact of dams on large river basins to create global maps illustrating potential changes in discharge and water stress for dam-impacted and free-flowing basins. The projections indicate that every populated basin in the world will experience changes in river discharge and many will experience water stress. The magnitude of these impacts is used to identify basins likely and almost certain to require proactive or reactive management intervention. Our analysis indicates that the area in need of management action to mitigate the impacts of climate change is much greater for basins impacted by dams than for basins with free-flowing rivers. Nearly one billion people live in areas likely to require action and approximately 365 million people live in basins almost certain to require action. Proactive management efforts will minimize risks to ecosystems and people and may be less costly than reactive efforts taken only once problems have arisen"

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can spatially resolve these nanoscale phenomena but lacks the time resolution for direct observation. We used a photoemitted electron pulse to probe dynamic events with \"snapshot\" diffraction and imaging at 15-nanosecond resolution inside of a dynamic TEM. With the use of this capability, the moving reaction front of reactive nanolaminates is observed in situ. Time-resolved images and diffraction show a transient cellular morphology in a dynamically mixing, self-propagating reaction front, revealing brief phase separation during cooling, and thus provide insights into the mechanisms driving the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis."

    "abstract": "Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a regulated catabolic pathway to degrade cellular organelles and macromolecules. The role of autophagy in cancer is complex and may differ depending on tumor type or context. Here we show that pancreatic cancers have a distinct dependence on autophagy. Pancreatic cancer primary tumors and cell lines show elevated autophagy under basal conditions. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy leads to increased reactive oxygen species, elevated DNA damage, and a metabolic defect leading to decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Together, these ultimately result in significant growth suppression of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Most importantly, inhibition of autophagy by genetic means or chloroquine treatment leads to robust tumor regression and prolonged survival in pancreatic cancer xenografts and genetic mouse models. These results suggest that, unlike in other cancers where autophagy inhibition may synergize with chemotherapy or targeted agents by preventing the up-regulation of autophagy as a reactive survival mechanism, autophagy is actually required for tumorigenic growth of pancreatic cancers de novo, and drugs that inactivate this process may have a unique clinical utility in treating pancreatic cancers and other malignancies with a similar dependence on autophagy. As chloroquine and its derivatives are potent inhibitors of autophagy and have been used safely in human patients for decades for a variety of purposes, these results are immediately translatable to the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients, and provide a much needed, novel vantage point of attack."

    "abstract": "The cell maintains a constant balance of redox processes, thus preserving regulating the balance between pro-oxidant production and antioxidant defense systems. Disruption of this balance leads to oxidative stress state which is characterized by increased levels of free radicals, leading to damage or cell death. Oxidative stress is associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases. In this regard, the evidence shows the oxidizing capacity of heavy metals, including chromium. However, this event can be regulated by nucleophilic nature substances which prevent or reverse the respective disorders. In this context, when the capacity of cellular response against the action of reactive oxygen species is suppressed, the intake of products that help keep the respective functional integrity is indispensable. Already reported some beneficial effects of antioxidants on the functional alterations promoted by heavy metals. The intent of this review is to summarize the scientific ability of chromium to induce pathology in different organ systems and the ability of some antioxidants to prevent or reverse this quality."

Moreover, many recent studies have suggested novel paradigms of NAD and NADP metabolism. Future investigation into the metabolism and biological functions of NAD and NADP may expose fundamental properties of life, and suggest new strategies for treating diseases and slowing the aging process."

    "abstract": "The ontogenetic development of both the immune and the nervous system entirely depend on external environmental signals that induce a lifelong learning process. The resulting collective immunological knowledge about the external world is transmitted in an epi-genetic fashion to the offspring, but only from the maternal and not the paternal side, with maternal IgG as the main transgenerational vector. As products of thymus-dependent responses, maternal IgG have undergone immune maturation by somatic hypermutations and are, therefore, acquired immunological phenotypes representing a great deal of the mother's immunological experience. During a limited neonatal imprinting period, maternal antibodies induce T cell-dependent idiotypic responses. These exert up to life-long determinative influences which may even be dominant over seemingly genetic predispositions. Such long-term immunological imprinting effects can be detected as (a) selection of the adult T and B cell repertoires, (b) anti-microbial protection by antigen-reactive antibodies (idiotypes) and anti-idiotypes, (c) allergen-specific suppression of IgE responsiveness by allergen-reactive IgG idiotype or corresponding anti-idiotype and (d) induction of autoimmune diseases by maternally-derived autoantibodies. Hence, immunological imprinting by maternal IgG antibodies will mostly be beneficial, but in case of autoantibodies can also be a burden for the initial development of the nascent immune system."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This article reviews the role of inflammation in development of atherosclerosis and associated complications and discusses use of the inflammatory marker - high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) - in risk stratification. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is based on selected publications retrieved from a non-systematic search of PubMed and the authors' experience within the field. RESULTS: Both chronic inflammatory disease and acute infections are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Influenza vaccination reduces the risk of coronary ischaemic events in patients with coronary artery disease, but the effect on cardiovascular mortality is not documented. Hs-CRP is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in populations with and without established cardiovascular disease. Treatment with Rosuvastatin led to decreased hs-CRP-levels and a reduced risk for cardiovascular events in subjects without known cardiovascular disease, with normal serum cholesterol and hs-CRP-levels above 2 mg/l. INTERPRETATION: Individuals with chronic inflammatory disease and those with high risk and acute infection are at risk for cardiovascular events and should be evaluated for primary prevention. In patient groups at moderate risk for cardiovascular disease, hs-CRP can be a valuable supplement to established factors for risk stratification. Despite numerous studies confirming hs-CRP's role as an independent risk marker, hs-CRP has not found its place in international guidelines. This should be reconsidered on the background of new study results. Link to the Ovid Full Text or citation http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&AN=19521445"

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Telephone quit lines are accessible to many smokers and are used to engage motivated smokers to make quit attempts. Smoking cessation counselling provided via telephone can either be reactive (i.e. primarily involving the provision of evidence-based information), or proactive (i.e. primarily involving repeated, sequenced calls from and interaction with trained cessation counsellors). Some studies have found proactive telephone counselling more effective and this trial will investigate whether or not proactive telephone support for smoking cessation, delivered through the National Health Service (NHS) Smoking Helpline is more effective or cost-effective than reactive support. It will also investigate whether or not providing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), in addition to telephone counselling, has an adjunctive impact on smoking cessation rates and whether or not this is cost effective. METHODS: This will be a parallel group, factorial design RCT, conducted through the English national NHS Smoking Helpline which is run from headquarters in Glasgow. Participants will be smokers who call the helpline from any location in England and who wish to stop smoking. If 644 participants are recruited to four equally-sized trial groups (total sample size = 2576), the trial will have 90% power for detecting a treatment effect (Odds Ratio) of 1.5 for each of the two interventions: i) proactive versus reactive support and ii) the offer of NRT versus no offer. The primary outcome measure for the study is self-reported, prolonged abstinence from smoking for at least six months following an agreed quit date. A concurrent health economic evaluation will investigate the cost effectiveness of the two interventions when delivered via a telephone helpline. DISCUSSION: The PORTSSS trial will provide high quality evidence to determine the most appropriate kind of counselling which should be provided via the NHS Smoking Helpline and also whether or not an additional offer of cost-free NRT is effective and cost effective for smoking cessation."

    "abstract": "Intermittent claudication has been studied in cardiovascular surveys but limited information is available on asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The purpose of this paper is to describe the prevalence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic disease and relation to ischaemic heart disease in the Edinburgh Artery Study. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on an age-stratified sample of men and women aged 55 to 74 years selected from age-sex registers in ten general practices in the city. Arterial disease was assessed in 1592 participants by means of the WHO questionnaire on intermittent claudication and measurement of the ankle brachial systolic pressure index (ABPI) and change in ankle systolic pressure during reactive hyperaemia. The prevalence of intermittent claudication was 4.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.5%-5.5%). Major asymptomatic disease causing a significant impairment of blood flow occurred in 8.0% (95% CI: 6.6%-9.4%). A further 16.6% (95% CI: 14.6%-18.5%) had criteria considered abnormal in clinical practice: 9.0% had ABPI less than 0.9 and 7.6% had reactive hyperaemia pressure reduction greater than 20%. Intermittent claudication was equally common in both sexes. The ABPI and reactive hyperaemia results suggested a slight preponderance of asymptomatic disease in males and were consistent with an increasing prevalence with age and lower social class. Mean ABPI was higher in normal men than women, and was lower in the left leg than the right suggesting a unilateral predisposition to disease. Subjects with major asymptomatic disease had more evidence of ischaemic heart disease than in the normal population (relative risk (RR) 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-1.9).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "A double-headed chymotrypsin inhibitor, WCI, from winged bean seeds was cloned for structural and biochemical studies. The inhibitor was subjected to two point mutations at a conserved position, Asn14. This residue, known to have a pivotal role in stabilizing the first reactive-site loop (Gln63-Phe68) of the inhibitor, is highly conserved in the sequences of the other members of Kunitz (STI) family as well as in the sequences of Kazal family of serine protease inhibitors. The mutants, N14K and N14D, were subjected to biochemical assay and their characteristics were compared with those of the recombinant inhibitor (rWCI). Crystallographic studies of the recombinant and the mutant proteins are discussed. These studies were primarily aimed at understanding the importance of the protein scaffolding towards the conformational rigidity of the reactive-site loop. Our analysis reveals that, as the Lys14 side chain takes an unusual fold in N14K and the Asp14 side chain in N14D interacts with the loop residues by water-mediated hydrogen bonds, the canonical conformation of the loop has remained effectively intact in both the mutant structures. However, minor alterations such as a 2-fold increase in the inhibitory affinity towards the cognate enzyme were observed."

    "abstract": "Although light is essential for photosynthesis, excess light can damage the photosynthetic apparatus and deregulate other cellular processes. Thus, protective integrated regulatory responses that can dissipate excess of absorbed light energy and simultaneously optimize photosynthesis and other cellular processes under variable light conditions can prove highly adaptive. Here, we show that the local and systemic responses to an excess light episode are associated with photoelectrophysiological signaling (PEPS) as well as with changes in nonphotochemical quenching and reactive oxygen species levels. During an excess light incident, PEPS is induced by quantum redox changes in photosystem II and in its proximity and/or by changes in glutathione metabolism in chloroplasts. PEPS is transduced, at least in part, by bundle sheath cells and is light wavelength specific. PEPS systemic propagation speed and action potential are dependent on ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE2 function. Excess light episodes are physiologically memorized in leaves, and the cellular light memory effect is specific for an excess of blue (450 nm) and red (650 nm) light of similar energy. It is concluded that plants possess a complex and dynamic light training and memory system that involves quantum redox, reactive oxygen species, hormonal, and PEPS signaling and is used to optimize light acclimation and immune defenses."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biclustering algorithms belong to a distinct class of clustering algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering of both rows and columns of the gene expression matrix and can be a very useful analysis tool when some genes have multiple functions and experimental conditions are diverse. Cheng and Church have introduced a measure called mean squared residue score to evaluate the quality of a bicluster and has become one of the most popular measures to search for biclusters. In this paper, we review basic concepts of the metaheuristics Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)-construction and local search phases and propose a new method which is a variant of GRASP called Reactive Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (Reactive GRASP) to detect significant biclusters from large microarray datasets. The method has two major steps. First, high quality bicluster seeds are generated by means of k-means clustering. In the second step, these seeds are grown using the Reactive GRASP, in which the basic parameter that defines the restrictiveness of the candidate list is self-adjusted, depending on the quality of the solutions found previously. RESULTS: We performed statistical and biological validations of the biclusters obtained and evaluated the method against the results of basic GRASP and as well as with the classic work of Cheng and Church. The experimental results indicate that the Reactive GRASP approach outperforms the basic GRASP algorithm and Cheng and Church approach. CONCLUSION: The Reactive GRASP approach for the detection of significant biclusters is robust and does not require calibration efforts."

    "abstract": "This paper considers neurocognitive models of aggression and relates them to explanations of the antisocial personality disorders. Two forms of aggression are distinguished: reactive aggression elicited in response to frustration/threat and goal directed, instrumental aggression. It is argued that different forms of neurocognitive model are necessary to explain the emergence of these different forms of aggression. Impairments in executive emotional systems (the somatic marker system or the social response reversal system) are related to reactive aggression shown by patients with \"acquired sociopathy\" due to orbitofrontal cortex lesions. Impairment in the capacity to form associations between emotional unconditioned stimuli, particularly distress cues, and conditioned stimuli (the violence inhibition mechanism model) is related to the instrumental aggression shown by persons with developmental psychopathy."

    "abstract": "Only three biological pathways are known to produce oxygen: photosynthesis, chlorate respiration and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis."

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are products of normal metabolism and xenobiotic exposure, and depending on their concentration, ROS can be beneficial or harmful to cells and tissues. At physiological low levels, ROS function as \"redox messengers\" in intracellular signaling and regulation, whereas excess ROS induce oxidative modification of cellular macromolecules, inhibit protein function, and promote cell death. Additionally, various redox systems, such as the glutathione, thioredoxin, and pyridine nucleotide redox couples, participate in cell signaling and modulation of cell function, including apoptotic cell death. Cell apoptosis is initiated by extracellular and intracellular signals via two main pathways, the death receptor- and the mitochondria-mediated pathways. Various pathologies can result from oxidative stress-induced apoptotic signaling that is consequent to ROS increases and/or antioxidant decreases, disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis, and irreversible oxidative modifications of lipid, protein, or DNA. In this review, we focus on several key aspects of ROS and redox mechanisms in apoptotic signaling and highlight the gaps in knowledge and potential avenues for further investigation. A full understanding of the redox control of apoptotic initiation and execution could underpin the development of therapeutic interventions targeted at oxidative stress-associated disorders."

    "abstract": "Fishing has led to local extirpations of reef fishes. For conservation and management purpose, it is important to identify all those species that are vulnerable to fishing, but this cannot be done using a priori assessments or by describing trends in abundance because the necessary scientific resources are not available. Thus the predictions of vulnerability that provide the basis for conservation action will have to be made with existing data or data that can be acquired rapidly before further extirpations occur. The life histories of species may determine their responses to exploitation, and we describe how an easily measured parameter, maximum observed size, is related to population trends of exploited fishes on coral reefs. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we demonstrated that species of grouper (Epinephelinae), snapper (Lujanidae), and parrotfish (Scaridae) that decreased in abundance more than their nearest phylogenetic relative had greater maximum size. Our results suggest that one can predict the vulnerability of reef fishes to exploitation based on responses of their relatives. The quality of the prediction was good for the intensively fished groupers and snappers but poor for the lightly fished parrotfishes. Our approach may help proactive conservationists and fishery managers identify and conserve vulnerable species in new, developing, or lightly exploited fisheries, thereby reducing their reliance on reactive management methods."

    "abstract": "Background: Vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid), a known enhancer of collagen deposition, has also been identified as an inhibitor of elastogenesis. Objective Present studies explored whether and how the l-ascorbic acid derivative (+) sodium l-ascorbate (SA) would affect production of collagen and elastic fibers in cultures of fibroblasts derived from normal human skin and dermal fat, as well as in explants of normal human skin, stretch-marked skin and keloids.Methods Effects of SA on the extracellular matrix production were assessed quantitatively by PCR analyses, western blots, biochemical assay of insoluble elastin and by immuno-histochemistry. We also evaluated effects of SA on production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of IGF-I and insulin receptors. Results SA, applied in 50-200. ??M concentrations, stimulates production of both collagen and elastic fibers in all tested cultures. Moreover, combination of SA with a proline hydroxylase inhibitor induces a beneficial remodelling in explants of dermal scars, resulting in the inhibition of collagen deposition and induction of new elastogenesis. Importantly, we revealed that SA stimulates elastogenesis only after intracellular influx of non-oxidized ascorbate anions (facilitated by the sodium-dependent ascorbate transporter), that causes reduction of intracellular ROS, activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase and the enhancement of IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor that ultimately triggers elastogenic signalling pathway. Conclusion Our results endorse the use of this potent stimulator of collagen and elastin production in the treatment of wrinkled and stretch-marked skin. They also encourage inclusion of SA into therapeutic combinations with collagenogenesis inhibitors to prevent formation of dermal scars and keloids. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

    "abstract": "While studies have investigated speed and change of direction speed in rugby league players, no study has investigated the reactive agility of these athletes. In addition, the relationship among speed, change of direction speed, and reactive agility within the specific context of rugby league has not been determined. With this in mind, the purpose of this study was to investigate a wide range of speed, change of direction speed, and reactive agility tests commonly used by rugby league coaches to determine which, if any tests discriminated higher and lesser skilled players, and to investigate the relationship among speed, change of direction speed, and reactive agility in these athletes. Forty-two rugby league players completed tests of speed (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m sprint), change of direction speed ('L' run, 505 test, and modified 505 test), and reactive agility. The validity of the tests to discriminate higher and lesser skilled competitors was evaluated by testing first grade (N = 12) and second grade (N = 30) players. First grade players had faster speed, and movement and decision times on the reactive agility test than second grade players. No significant differences were detected between first and second grade players for change of direction speed. While movement times on the reactive agility test were significantly related to 10 m and 20 m sprint times and change of direction speed, no significant relationships were detected among measures of decision time and response accuracy during the reactive agility test and measures of linear speed and change of direction speed. These findings question the validity of preplanned change of direction speed tests for discriminating higher and lesser skilled rugby league players, while also highlighting the contribution of perceptual skill to agility in these athletes. © 2008, National Strength and Conditioning Association."

    "abstract": "At high concentrations, free radicals and radical-derived, nonradical reactive species are hazardous for living organisms and damage all major cellular constituents. At moderate concentrations, however, nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion, and related reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role as regulatory mediators in signaling processes. Many of the ROS-mediated responses actually protect the cells against oxidative stress and reestablish \"redox homeostasis.\" Higher organisms, however, have evolved the use of NO and ROS also as signaling molecules for other physiological functions. These include regulation of vascular tone, monitoring of oxygen tension in the control of ventilation and erythropoietin production, and signal transduction from membrane receptors in various physiological processes. NO and ROS are typically generated in these cases by tightly regulated enzymes such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. In a given signaling protein, oxidative attack induces either a loss of function, a gain of function, or a switch to a different function. Excessive amounts of ROS may arise either from excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidases or from less well-regulated sources such as the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. In mitochondria, ROS are generated as undesirable side products of the oxidative energy metabolism. An excessive and/or sustained increase in ROS production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, obstructive sleep apnea, and other diseases. In addition, free radicals have been implicated in the mechanism of senescence. That the process of aging may result, at least in part, from radical-mediated oxidative damage was proposed more than 40 years ago by Harman (J Gerontol 11: 298-300, 1956). There is growing evidence that aging involves, in addition, progressive changes in free radical-mediated regulatory processes that result in altered gene expression."

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides have established an important role in the defense against extracellular infections, but the expression of cationic peptides within macrophages as an antibacterial effector mechanism against intracellular pathogens has not been demonstrated. Macrophage expression of the murine cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) was increased after infection by the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, and this increase required reactive oxygen intermediates. By using CRAMP-deficient mice or synthetic CRAMP peptide, we found that CRAMP impaired Salmonella cell division in vivo and in vitro, resulting in long filamentous bacteria. This impaired bacterial cell division also depended on intracellular elastase-like serine protease activity, which can proteolytically activate cathelicidins. Macrophage serine protease activity induced filamentation and enhanced the activity of CRAMP in vitro. A peptide-sensitive Salmonella mutant showed enhanced survival within macrophages derived from CRAMP-deficient mice, indicating that Salmonella can sense and respond to cationic peptides in the intracellular environment. Although cationic peptides have been hypothesized to have activity against pathogens within macrophages, this work provides experimental evidence that the antimicrobial arsenal of macrophages includes cathelicidins. These results show that intracellular reactive oxygen intermediates and proteases regulate macrophage CRAMP expression and activity to impair the replication of an intracellular bacterial pathogen, and they highlight the cooperativity between macrophage antibacterial effectors."

    "abstract": "The ability to produce vigorous immune responses that spare self tissues and organs depends on the elimination of autoreactive T and B cells. However, purging of immature and mature self-reactive T and B cells is incomplete and may also require the involvement of cells programmed to suppress immune responses. Regulatory T cells (T(reg)) belonging to the CD4(+) T-cell subset may have a role in preventing untoward inflammatory responses, but T-cell subsets programmed to inhibit the development of autoantibody formation and systemic-lupus-erythematosus-like disease have not yet been defined. Here we delineate a CD8(+) regulatory T-cell lineage that is essential for the maintenance of self tolerance and prevention of murine autoimmune disease. Genetic disruption of the inhibitory interaction between these CD8(+) T cells and their target Qa-1(+) follicular T-helper cells results in the development of a lethal systemic-lupus-erythematosus-like autoimmune disease. These findings define a sublineage of CD8 T cells programmed to suppress rather than activate immunity that represents an essential regulatory element of the immune response and a guarantor of self tolerance."

Although their heterotrimeric receptors have two receptor subunits in common, these two cytokines have contrasting roles in adaptive immune responses. The unique role of interleukin-2 is in the elimination of self-reactive T cells to prevent autoimmunity. By contrast, interleukin-15 is dedicated to the prolonged maintenance of memory T-cell responses to invading pathogens. As discussed in this Review, the biology of these cytokines will affect the development of novel therapies for malignancy and autoimmune diseases, as well as the design of vaccines against infectious diseases."

    "abstract": "Does plasticity contribute to adult cognitive development, and if so, in what ways? The vague and overused concept of plasticity makes these controversial questions difficult to answer. In this article, we refine the notion of adult cognitive plasticity and sharpen its conceptual distinctiveness. According to our framework, adult cognitive plasticity is driven by a prolonged mismatch between functional organismic supplies and environmental demands and denotes the brain's capacity for anatomically implementing reactive changes in behavioral flexibility (i.e., the possible range of performance and function). We distinguish between 2 interconnected but distinct cognitive outcomes of adult cognitive plasticity: alterations in processing efficiency and alterations in representations. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework in evaluating and interpreting (a) increments in frontal brain activations in the course of normal aging and (b) the effects of cognitive training in adulthood and old age. Finally, we outline new research questions and predictions generated by the present framework and recommend design features for future cognitive-training studies."

    "abstract": "Research on the role of parenting styles in the development of disruptive behaviour problems has focused primarily on how parents handle conflict once it has occurred. This home observational study examined strategies used by 52 mothers to prevent conflict with 3-year-olds. It was predicted that mothers of children with behaviour problems would use fewer \"positive\" strategies to resolve conflict, and would use reactive rather than pre-emptive strategies. Results showed frequency of positive strategies did not differ between the groups. Mothers of children with behaviour problems were less likely to use pre-emptive, and more likely to use reactive, strategies. Further analysis showed child conduct problems, rather than other characteristics, best discriminated pre-emptive from reactive strategy users. Follow-up of a subsample found that reactive strategies at age 3 predicted age 5 behaviour problems, even after controlling for age 3 behaviour problems."

We show that 2D rectangular automata, which model discrete reactive systems with continuous environments, define effectively presented infinite graphs with finite similarity relations. It follows that the refinement problem and the ?CTL* model-checking problem are decidable for 2D rectangular automata"

    "abstract": "Reactive astrocytosis develops in many neurologic diseases, including epilepsy. Astrocytotic contributions to pathophysiology are poorly understood. Studies examining this are confounded by comorbidities accompanying reactive astrocytosis. We found that high-titer transduction of astrocytes with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) via adeno-associated virus induced reactive astrocytosis without altering the intrinsic properties or anatomy of neighboring neurons. We examined the consequences of selective astrocytosis induction on synaptic transmission in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. Neurons near eGFP-labeled reactive astrocytes had reduced inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptic currents. This inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) erosion resulted from a failure of the astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle. Reactive astrocytes downregulated expression of glutamine synthetase. Blockade of this enzyme normally induces rapid synaptic GABA depletion. In astrocytotic regions, residual inhibition lost sensitivity to glutamine synthetase blockade, whereas exogenous glutamine administration enhanced IPSCs. Astrocytosis-mediated deficits in inhibition triggered glutamine-reversible hyperexcitability in hippocampal circuits. Thus, reactive astrocytosis could generate local synaptic perturbations, leading to broader functional deficits associated with neurologic disease."

    "abstract": "Observation of eight mother cats and their litters revealed that the previous occurrence of a kitten vocalization was associated with an increased probabil- ity that mothers would approach kittens, change to a different body position, shift their lactation position, or vocalize. Experimental study, in which the effects of kitten vocalizations were separated from other kitten-emitted cues, demonstrated that vocalizations reliably elicited approach and investigation of the sound source from mothers. Further, mothers exposed to kitten vocali- zations removed kittens from a box and carried them to the home site. Repeated testing of mothers demonstrated that these effects of kitten vocali- zations on maternal behavior remained strong across at least the first 30 days of life. It is concluded that vocalizations are a stimulus by which kittens influence their mother's behavior."

    "abstract": "1. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is intimately associated with central sympathetic and somatic control of the lower urinary tract. The sympathetic and somatic innervation of the lower urinary tract is conveyed through efferent axons of the hypogastric and pudendal nerves, respectively. 2. The present study examined the effects of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenylisopropylamine (DOI), a 5-HT2 receptor subtype-selective agonist, on evoked potentials recorded from the central ends of the hypogastric and pudendal nerves in response to electrical stimulation of afferent fibres in the pelvic and pudendal nerves, respectively. Various spinalization paradigms were employed to localize the site of action. All cats were pretreated with xylamidine (1 mg kg-1), a peripherally-restricted 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. 3. In acute spinal cats, DOI (0.01-3 mg kg-1, i.v.) reliably produced dose-dependent increases in the pudendal nerve reflex (to 228 +/- 31% of control). These increases were reversed by the 5-HT2 receptor-selective antagonist, LY53857 (0.3-3 mg kg-1, i.v.). On the other hand, in spinally-intact cats, DOI produced no significant changes in the pudendal reflex. However, within minutes of spinalization of DOI-pretreated cats, a marked increase (to 221 +/- 16% of control) in the pudendal reflex was observed which could be reversed by LY53857. No significant effects were observed on hypogastric reflexes in either acute spinal or spinally-intact cats following DOI administration. No effects were seen in either spinally-intact or acute spinal animals when LY53857 was administered as the initial drug. 4. These results indicate that activation of spinal 5-HT2 receptors facilitates pudendal reflexes. In spinally-intact cats, it is hypothesized that DOI activates supraspinal pathways that mediate inhibition of the pudendal reflexes and counteracts the facilitatory effects of spinal 5-HT2 receptor activation."

Eighteen adult cats (11 healthy and seven with chronic kidney disease) were included. Plasma concentrations of Gd-DTPA following intravenous injection were measured with an ELISA kit (FIT-GFR). Results for Gd-DTPA GFR were compared with simultaneously obtained values for plasma clearance of iohexol (iohexol GFR), plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations. A negative correlation existed between iohexol GFR and plasma concentrations of BUN and creatinine. A positive correlation existed between Gd-DTPA GFR and iohexol GFR. There was no correlation between Gd-DTPA GFR and plasma concentrations of BUN and creatinine. In this study plasma clearance of Gd-DTPA assayed by FIT-GFR did not appear to provide a sufficiently accurate estimation of GFR in cats when compared with plasma clearance of iohexol, and plasma concentrations of BUN and creatinine."

The greatest difference observed was elevation in the rate of K+-stimulated release of acetylcholine (ACh) from brain slices prepared from affected cats. The K+-stimulated release of endogenous ACh was increased by 31-43% and of newly synthesized ACh by 19-80% in brain slices from different brain regions. All regions that were examined were affected but the greatest effects occurred in cortex. The rate of synthesis of ACh was elevated in cortical and hippocampal slices. Choline acetyltransferase activity in brain regions of cats with GM1 gangliosidosis was not significantly different from that in controls, whereas high-affinity choline transport in cortical synaptosomes was elevated. Muscarinic receptor binding sites were reduced in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of GM1 mutant cats, whereas the apparent affinity was not altered. These results indicate that there are major alterations of cholinergic function in the brains of cats with GM1 gangliosidosis."

    "abstract": "To understand the function of cerebellar granule cells, we need detailed knowledge about the information carried by their afferent mossy fibers and how this information is integrated by the granule cells. Recently, we made whole cell recordings from granule cells in the non-anesthetized, decerebrate cats. All recordings were made in the forelimb area of the C3 zone for which the afferent and efferent connections and functional organization have been investigated in detail. Major findings of the study were that the mossy fiber input to single granule cells was modality- and receptive field-specific and that simultaneous activity in two and usually more of the afferent mossy fibers were required to activate the granule cell spike. The high threshold for action potentials and the convergence of afferents with virtually identical information suggest that an important function of granule cells is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the mossy fiber-parallel fiber information. Thus a high-sensitivity, noisy mossy fiber input is transformed by the granule cell to a high-sensitivity, low-noise signal."

    "abstract": "Bengal tigers are highly endangered and knowledge on adaptive genetic variation can be essential for efficient conservation and management. Here we present the first assessment of allelic variation in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II DRB genes for wild and captive tigers from India. We amplified, cloned, and sequenced alpha-1 and alpha-2 domain of MHC class I and beta-1 domain of MHC class II DRB genes in 16 tiger specimens of different geographic origin. We detected high variability in peptide-binding sites, presumably resulting from positive selection. Tigers exhibit a low number of MHC DRB alleles, similar to other endangered big cats. Our initial assessment-admittedly with limited geographic coverage and sample size-did not reveal significant differences between captive and wild tigers with regard to MHC variability. In addition, we successfully amplified MHC DRB alleles from scat samples. Our characterization of tiger MHC alleles forms a basis for further in-depth analyses of MHC variability in this illustrative threatened mammal."

A longer onset time and duration of neuromuscular blockade occurred during enflurane and halothane anesthesia. The apparent elimination half-life was longer and the total voluem of distribution at steady state larger during halothane anesthesia. The plasma concentration of pancuronium required for neuromuscular blockades was less during enflurane than during the other three anesthetics. We conclude that inhalation anesthetics may prolong a neuromuscular blockade by altering both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pancuronium."

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, blinded clinical trial. ANIMALS: Twenty-one adult female cats (mean body weight: 3.1 +/- 0.4 kg). METHODS: Cats received DEX (4 microg kg(-1), IM). Fifteen minutes later, anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Cats were divided into three groups. In GI cats received epidural lidocaine (1 mg kg(-1), n = 7), in GII cats were given epidural lidocaine (1 mg kg(-1)) + DEX (4 microg kg(-1), n = 7), and in GIII cats were given epidural lidocaine (1 mg kg(-1)) + IV constant rate infusion (CRI) of DEX (0.25 microg kg(-1) minute(-1), n = 7). Variables evaluated included heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (f(R)), systemic arterial pressures, rectal temperature (RT), end-tidal CO(2), end-tidal isoflurane concentration (e'ISO), arterial blood gases, and muscle tone. Anesthetic recovery was compared among groups by evaluation of times to recovery, HR, f(R), RT, and degree of analgesia. A paired t-test was used to evaluate pre-medication variables and blood gases within groups. anova was used to compare parametric data, whereas Friedman test was used to compare muscle relaxation. RESULTS: Epidural and CRI of DEX reduced HR during anesthesia maintenance. Mean +/- SD e'ISO ranged from 0.86 +/- 0.28% to 1.91 +/- 0.63% in GI, from 0.70 +/- 0.12% to 0.97 +/- 0.20% in GII, and from 0.69 +/- 0.12% to 1.17 +/- 0.25% in GIII. Cats in GII and GIII had longer recovery periods than in GI. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Epidural and CRI of DEX significantly decreased isoflurane consumption and resulted in recovery of better quality and longer duration, despite bradycardia, without changes in systemic blood pressure."

    "abstract": "Dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT) neurons transmit sensory signals to the cerebellum that encode global hindlimb parameters, such as the hindlimb end-point position and its direction of movement. Here we use a population analysis approach to examine further the characteristics of DSCT neuronal responses during continuous movements of the hind foot. We used a robot to move the hind paw of anesthetized cats through the trajectories of a step or a figure-8 footpath in a parasagittal plane. Extracellular recordings from 82 cells converted to cycle histograms provided the basis for a principal-component analysis to determine the common features of the DSCT movement responses. Five principal components (PCs) accounted for about 80% of the total variance in the waveforms across units. The first two PCs accounted for about 60% of the variance and they were highly robust across samples. We examined the relationship between the responses and limb kinematic parameters by correlating the PC waveforms with waveforms of the joint angle and limb axis trajectories using multivariate linear regression models. Each PC waveform could be at least partly explained by a linear relationship to joint-angle trajectories, but except for the first PC, they required multiple angles. However, the limb axis parameters more closely related to both the first and second PC waveforms. In fact, linear regression models with limb axis length and orientation trajectories as predictors explained 94% of the variance in both PCs, and each was related to a particular linear combination of position and velocity. The first PC correlated with the limb axis orientation and orientation velocity trajectories, whereas second PC with the length and length velocity trajectories. These combinations were found to correspond to the dynamics of muscle spindle responses. The first two PCs were also most representative of the data set since about half the DSCT responses could be at least 85% accounted for by weighted linear combinations of these two PCs. Higher-order PCs were unrelated to limb axis trajectories and accounted instead for different dynamic components of the responses. The findings imply that an explicit and independent representation of the limb axis length and orientation may be present at the lowest levels of sensory processing in the spinal cord."

    "abstract": "There is a need for new technical approaches whereby the cerebral microcirculation can be easily and continuously assessed. The objective of this study was to determine whether laser-Doppler (LD) flowmetry can be utilized to assess changes in cerebral cortical blood flow and to determine whether changes in blood perfusion measured by LD flowmetry correlate with simultaneously measured changes in flow measured by H2 clearance in cats or with changes in pial arteriolar diameter measured with a microscope in rabbits equipped with a closed cranial window. In the rabbit experiments a 0.84-mm-diam LD probe was inserted through a cranial window port, and in the cat experiments the probe was fixed adjacent to the H2 probe. The probe was fixed at a distance of 1-2 mm from the cortical surface, where it and its associated electronics detect changes in blood cell velocity and blood volume within a tissue volume of approximately 1 mm3. Volume and velocity are multiplied to provide a flow signal. When cerebral blood flow in cats was decreased by hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia and increased by norepinephrine- induced hypertension, the percent changes in LD flow and H2 clearance flow changed linearly (r = 0.94, slope = 0.97). When arterial PCO2 was increased from 28 to 48 mmHg in the rabbit experiments, the pial arterioles dilated 19 +/- 4% (mean +/- SE) and LD flow increased by 74 +/- 9%, LD flow changes which would be predicted by a third power relationship of diameter to flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Assays based on polymerase chain reaction technology are the most sensitive and specific diagnostic tests available for these organisms. M haemofelis is the most pathogenic species, and causes hemolytic anemia in immunocompetent cats. Other differential diagnoses for hemolytic anemia should be considered in cats testing positive for \"Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\" and \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum,\" because the presence of these organisms is not always associated with anemia. Blood from infected cats should be handled with care because of the potential zoonotic nature of hemoplasma infections. The treatment of choice for cats with clinical disease is doxycycline."

    "abstract": "Micturition in cats and rats with an intact neuraxis is dependent upon a spinobulbospinal reflex activated by A delta bladder afferents. This report describes changes in micturition reflexes 2 h to 14 weeks following spinal cord transection at the lower thoracic level. In acute spinal cats micturition reflexes were blocked, however, several weeks after transection, a long latency (180-200 ms) spinal reflex could be activated by C-fiber bladder afferents. This reflex was blocked by capsaicin in doses (20-30 mg/kg, s.c.) that did not affect micturition reflexes in intact cats. Micturition reflexes were unmasked in acute spinal and facilitated in chronic spinal cats by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Spinal neurons and axons containing opioid peptides were more prominent below the level of transection in chronic spinal cats. VIP, a putative neurotransmitter in C-fiber bladder afferents, inhibited micturition reflexes when injected intrathecally (2-10 micrograms) in intact cats but facilitated micturition reflexes in spinal cats (doses 0.1-1 micrograms, i.t.). VIP-containing C-fiber afferent projections to lamina I of the sacral spinal cord expanded in spinal cats. Thus VIP afferents may have an important role in the recovery of bladder reflexes after spinal injury. Paraplegic animals also exhibit bladder-sphincter dyssynergia, which causes functional outlet obstruction. Studies in rats have revealed that outlet obstruction induced by partial urethral ligation facilitates spinal micturition reflex pathways and causes an expansion of HRP-labelled bladder afferent projections in the spinal cord. These findings raise the possibility that the alterations in central reflex connections in paraplegic animals may be induced in part by changes in peripheral afferent input secondary to outlet obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "While the importance of viral infections is well studied in domestic cats, only limited information is available on their occurence and prevalence in the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV), calicivirus (FCV), herpesvirus (FHV), parvovirus (FPV), immunodeficiency virus (FIV), leukemia virus (FeLV), and FeLV antigenemia in 51 European wildcat sera. Samples were collected between 1996 and 1997 from wildcat populations in France, Switzerland, and Germany. Antibodies to FCoV were detected in two cats (4%) and FCoV RNA was detected in feces of one of these two cats. Antibodies to FCV, FHV and FPV were found at relatively low frequencies of 16%, 4%, and 2%, respectively. Antibodies to FIV were not detected. Although antigen and antibodies to FeLV were detected in 49%, and 75%, respectively, no evidence of FeLV-associated pathology was found. From the low prevalence of FCoV, FCV, FHV and FPV infections and from the fact that the European wildcats live solitarily, it was concluded that these viral infections do not spread readily within a population. Therefore, it may be assumed that release into the wild of European wildcats bred in captivity would not bring about a high risk of introducing of these viral infections to the free-ranging wildcats. As an exception, wildcats should be tested for absence of FIV infection before release if they were at risk to acquire this infection from domestic cats."

In this study, acromegaly was diagnosed in 15 cats on the basis of compatible clinical signs, laboratory, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. MRI findings were reviewed retrospectively. Enlargement of the pituitary gland with suprasellar extension was present in all cats. No characteristic signal patterns were identified on T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences. Contrast enhancement was nonuniform in all cats, as was suspected involvement of the adjacent hypothalamus. A mass effect on the cavernous sinus and third ventricle was present in 13 cats. Mild peritumoral edema was present in four cats, and moderate edema in one cat. Transtentorial herniation was present in one cat. Histopathology confirmed the presence of a pituitary adenoma in two cases. MRI is a useful modality to establish the diagnosis of acromegaly."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a cognitive activation theory of stress (CATS), with a formal system of systematic definitions. The term \"stress\" is used for four aspects of \"stress\", stress stimuli, stress experience, the non-specific, general stress response, and experience of the stress response. These four meanings may be measured separately. The stress response is a general alarm in a homeostatic system, producing general and unspecific neurophysiological activation from one level of arousal to more arousal. The stress response occurs whenever there is something missing, for instance a homeostatic imbalance, or a threat to homeostasis and life of the organism. Formally, the alarm occurs when there is a discrepancy between what should be and what is-between the value a variable should have (set value (SV)), and the real value (actual value (AV)) of the same variable. The stress response, therefore, is an essential and necessary physiological response. The unpleasantness of the alarm is no health threat. However, if sustained, the response may lead to illness and disease through established pathophysiological processes (\"allostatic load\"). The alarm elicits specific behaviors to cope with the situation. The level of alarm depends on expectancy of the outcome of stimuli and the specific responses available for coping. Psychological defense is defined as a distortion of stimulus expectancies. Response outcome expectancies are defined as positive, negative, or none, to the available responses. This offers formal definitions of coping, hopelessness, and helplessness that are easy to operationalize in man and in animals. It is an essential element of CATS that only when coping is defined as positive outcome expectancy does the concept predict relations to health and disease."

    "abstract": "Objective--To determine whether there was an association between hypertensive retinopathy and high systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures in cats. Animals--181 cats. Procedure--Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures were measured by use of a noninvasive oscillometric technique. The range of blood pressure measurements in healthy cats from various age groups was determined. Associations among systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure; hypertensive retinopathy; hyperthyroidism; left ventricular cardiac hypertrophy; chronic renal failure; and serum biochemical abnormalities were determined. Results--All blood pressure measurements increased with age in healthy cats. The frequency of hypertensive retinopathy also increased with age and with blood pressure, and hypertensive retinopathy was particularly found in cats with systolic blood pressures > 168 mm Hg. There was an increased risk for hypertensive retinopathy in cats that were female, > 10 years old, and neutered. The risk of chronic renal failure also increased as blood pressure, particularly systolic blood pressure, increased. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance--Hypertensive retinopathy was common in cats â‰¥10 years of age and was associated with systolic blood pressures > 168 mm Hg when measured by the noninvasive oscillometric technique.

    "abstract": "This chapter discusses Toxoplasma gondii natural history, survival in the environment, clinical features, treatment, methods of detection, genetic variation, epidemiology, risk assessment and risk management. Toxoplasma gondii is arguably one of the most successful parasites, being able to infect all warm blooded animals including humans leading to lifelong infections. Transmission to humans can occur by eating undercooked meat, containing the parasite, or by ingestion of oocysts, which are the environmentally stable form of the parasite. Oocysts are produced by cats and are excreted in their faeces. The infective dose is very low, with less than 10 oocysts being required to establish an infection. Contact with oocysts can occurs while cleaning cat litter trays, gardening, eating contaminated fruit or vegetables and by drinking oocysts in water. Toxoplasma gondii oocysts can survive drinking water treatment but infection with the parasite is rarely noticed, and therefore very few outbreaks have been reported. Recent research from the USA suggests that human infection with oocysts is far more common than previously thought; however, the role of waterborne transmission still needs to be investigated further. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved."

    "abstract": "Tachyzoites, bradyzoites (in tissue cysts), and sporozoites (in oocysts) are the three infectious stages of Toxoplasma gondii. The prepatent period (time to shedding of oocysts after primary infection) varies with the stage of T. gondii ingested by the cat. The prepatent period (pp) after ingesting bradyzoites is short (3-10 days) while it is long (18 days or longer) after ingesting oocysts or tachyzoites. The conversion of bradyzoites to tachyzoites and tachyzoites to bradyzoites is biologically important in the life cycle of T. gondii and it has been proposed that the pp can be used to study stage conversion. In the present study, infectivity of oocysts and bradyzoites released from tissue cysts of a recent isolate of T. gondii, TgCkAr23, to cats and mice was compared. Ten-fold dilutions of oocysts or bradyzoites were administered orally to cats, and orally and subcutaneously to mice. Of the 29 cats each fed 1-10 million oocysts only one cat shed oocysts and the pp was 23 days; all cats remained asymptomatic. In contrast, all mice administered the same 10-fold dilutions of oocysts either orally or subcutaneously died of toxoplasmosis. The results confirm that infectivity of the oocysts to cats is lower than for mice and that oocysts are non-pathogenic for cats. Of the 41 cats each fed 1-1000 free bradyzoites, 15 shed oocysts with a short pp of 4-9 days, and all remained asymptomatic. The infectivity of bradyzoites to mice by the oral route was approximately 100 times lower than that by the subcutaneous route. The results confirm the hypothesis that the pp in cats is stage and not dose dependent, and that transmission of T. gondii is most efficient when cats consume tissue cysts (carnivory) or when intermediate hosts consume oocysts (fecal-oral transmission)."

    "abstract": "Biochemical markers of bone cell activity have recently been shown to be useful for monitoring skeletal health in domestic animals, including dogs and horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate a number of biochemical assays, originally developed for use in humans, for their ability to measure indicators of bone cell activity in serum and urine of normal cats over a range of ages. Bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), a marker of bone formation, was measured in serum using wheatgerm lectin precipitation (WGL) and by ELISA. The curve derived from serial dilution of feline serum was parallel with the ELISA standard curve, indicating species cross-reactivity, and there was a significant relationship between assays (rs=0.97,Prs=0.69,Prs=0.95,Prs=0.82,Prs=0.59,Prs=0.65,Prs=-0.66, -0.88, -0.61, -0.70, and -0.51, P<0.05 respectively). Cats under two years of age had significantly higher BAP, total urinary DPD (HPLC), and urinary CTX concentrations compared to older cats. In conclusion, this study has shown that a number of commercially available assays provide reliable methods for non-invasively monitoring bone cell activity in cats and has shown that bone turnover decreases within the first two years of life, until complete skeletal maturity is attained. Future studies can now be directed at evaluating the potential clinical application of these methods"

Single Western Chat-tanager nests were found on 17 May 2002 and 9 June 2004. Both were coarsely-built, partially-domed, bulky structures 1.0&#8211;1.5 m above ground. One nest was freshly-depredated when found, whereas the second contained two eggs which hatched on 19 and 20 June. The nestlings were depredated on 25 June. A Hispaniolan Highland-tanager nest found on 27 June 2004 fledged a single chick the following day. This nest, in a vine tangle 2.5 m above ground, was an open cup structure composed of moss, small herbaceous stems, leaf fragments, lichens, and other plant fibers. We describe the eggs of both species, the nestlings of Western Chat-tanager, and the juvenal plumage of Hispaniolan Highland-tanager. We believe that depredation by introduced feral cats (Felis domesticus) and rats (Rattus spp.) is a serious problem in these montane forests."

All of the tumors were located in sites potentially used for vaccination. Six cats had a greater than 50% decrease in gross tumor burden. However, the responses were not durable, with a median response duration of 125 days. All cats developed progressive disease. When animals that received other treatments after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy were eliminated from the analysis, median survival time was significantly longer for cats that responded to chemotherapy compared with the median survival time for nonresponders (242 and 83 days, respectively). These findings may serve as a basis for further evaluating the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of vaccine-associated sarcomas."

    "abstract": "To gain insight into the mechanism of coordination of stepping in the fore and hind legs of quadrupeds, we examined the kinematics of leg movements and the motor patterns in fore and hind leg flexor muscles in decerebrate walking cats when the two pairs of legs stepped on separate treadmills running at different speeds. When the front treadmill was slowed progressively from 0.6 to 0.3 m/s with the rear treadmill running at 0.6 m/s, the rate of stepping in both the fore and hind legs decreased and a 1:1 stepping ratio was maintained. The decrease in the rate of stepping in the hind legs was due primarily to an increase in the duration of the swing phase. Slowing the speed of the rear treadmill while keeping the front treadmill speed at 0.6 m/s decreased the rate of stepping of the hind legs, but had relatively little influence on the average rate of stepping in the forelegs. In this situation stepping in the fore and hind legs was uncoupled and the time of stepping in one hind leg relative to the ipsilateral foreleg progressively shifted during a walking sequence. Analysis of the timing of electromyographic (EMG) recordings from flexor muscles of the hip and elbow joints yielded insight into the neuronal mechanisms underlying the asymmetry in slowing either the front or rear treadmill. We propose that ipsilateral pattern generating networks are asymmetrically coupled via descending inhibitory pathways and an ascending excitatory pathway. We discuss how the characteristics of these linkages are functionally appropriate for establishing the normal timing of stepping in the hind and forelegs during slow walking."

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury disrupts micturition reflexes, which produces morbidity. The contribution of endogenous opioid systems to urinary retention were assessed in chronic spinal cats by administering the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (5-500 micrograms kg-1, i.p.), to unanesthetized paraplegic cats while monitoring lower urinary tract function and observing hind limb reflexes. While naloxone had no overt effect in acute spinal cats, in chronic spinal cats naloxone induced the release of large volumes of urine and produced marked hind limb hyper-reflexia. Prominent tachyphylaxis and tolerance to the effects of naloxone were evident. Immunohistochemical studies indicated a marked increase in leucine enkephalin and dynorphin in sacral spinal neurons. Together, these data indicate hyperactivity of the endogenous spinal opioid system following recovery from spinal cord injury and, furthermore, suggest that the spinal neural circuitry may become 'dependent' upon elevated levels of endogenous opioid peptides."

    "abstract": "The anatomical and biophysical specializations of octopus cells allow\\nthem to detect the coincident firing of groups of auditory nerve\\nfibers and to convey the precise timing of that coincidence to their\\ntargets. Octopus cells occupy a sharply defined region of the most\\ncaudal and dorsal part of the mammalian ventral cochlear nucleus.\\nThe dendrites of octopus cells cross the bundle of auditory nerve\\nfibers just proximal to where the fibers leave the ventral and enter\\nthe dorsal cochlear nucleus, each octopus cell spanning about one-third\\nof the tonotopic array. Octopus cells are excited by auditory nerve\\nfibers through the activation of rapid, calcium-permeable, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate\\nreceptors. Synaptic responses are shaped by the unusual biophysical\\ncharacteristics of octopus cells. Octopus cells have very low input\\nresistances (about 7 M Omega), and short time constants (about 200\\nmicrosec) as a consequence of the activation at rest of a hyperpolarization-activated\\nmixed-cation conductance and a low-threshold, depolarization-activated\\npotassium conductance. The low input resistance causes rapid synaptic\\ncurrents to generate rapid and small synaptic potentials. Summation\\nof small synaptic potentials from many fibers is required to bring\\nan octopus cell to threshold. Not only does the low input resistance\\nmake individual excitatory postsynaptic potentials brief so that\\nthey must be generated within 1 msec to sum but also the voltage-sensitive\\nconductances of octopus cells prevent firing if the activation of\\nauditory nerve inputs is not sufficiently synchronous and depolarization\\nis not sufficiently rapid. In vivo in cats, octopus cells can fire\\nrapidly and respond with exceptionally well-timed action potentials\\nto periodic, broadband sounds such as clicks. Thus both the anatomical\\nspecializations and the biophysical specializations make octopus\\ncells detectors of the coincident firing of their auditory nerve\\nfiber inputs."

    "abstract": "Melanomas diagnosed in 29 cats over an 11 year period included 19 ocular (16 intraocular, three palpebral), five oral, and five dermal melanomas. Intraocular melanomas involved the ciliary body and iris in 12; the whole eye was involved in four. The average age of cats with intraocular melanomas was 11 years; the female : male ratio was 9 : 7. Histologically, eight intraocular tumors were mixed, six were epithelioid, and two were spindle cell. Ten of 16 cats (62.5%) with intraocular melanomas were killed because of the tumor at a mean of 156 days; four are living with no evidence of disease (average, 255 days). The mean time of death in cats with palpebral melanoma was 409 days. Metastasis occurred in 63% of cats with intraocular melanoma and all cats with palpebral melanoma. Four cats with oral melanoma were killed at a mean of 61 days; all had metastasis. Of five cats with cutaneous melanoma, one was killed with metastasis at 90 days; three cats were alive without evidence of recurrence or metastasis greater than 365 days after surgery. Results of this study indicate that in the cat, ocular melanomas are more common than oral and dermal melanomas, and ocular and oral melanomas are more malignant than dermal melanomas, with higher rates of mortality and metastasis."

    "abstract": "Studies on processing in primary visual areas often use artificial stimuli such as bars or gratings. As a result, little is known about the properties of activity patterns for the natural stimuli processed by the visual system on a daily basis. Furthermore, in the cat, a well-studied model system for visual processing, most results are obtained from anesthetized subjects and little is known about neuronal activations in the alert animal. Addressing these issues, we measure local field potentials (lfp) and multiunit spikes in the primary visual cortex of awake cats. We compare changes in the lfp power spectra and multiunit firing rates for natural movies, movies with modified spatio-temporal correlations as well as gratings. The activity patterns elicited by drifting gratings are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those elicited by natural stimuli and this difference arises from both spatial as well as temporal properties of the stimuli. Furthermore, both local field potentials and multiunit firing rates are most sensitive to the second-order statistics of the stimuli and not to their higher-order properties. Finally, responses to natural movies show a large variability over time because of activity fluctuations induced by rapid stimulus motion. We show that these fluctuations are not dependent on the detailed spatial properties of the stimuli but depend on their temporal jitter. These fluctuations are important characteristics of visual activity under natural conditions and impose limitations on the readout of possible differences in mean activity levels."

    "abstract": "Abstract: From October 1994 to April 1996, I surveyed six Atlantic forest reserves, two large (approximately 20,000 ha each), two medium-sized (approximately 2000 ha each), and two small (approximately 200 ha each), located in northern Esp�rito Santo, southeastern Brazil, for mammals openface> 1 kg body weight. My main objective was to assess the effects of fragmentation on population sizes and densities of five abundant species of forest-dwelling species (three primates and two rodents). I used line-transect sampling to survey mammals and estimated densities through the DISTANCE program. The average density of mammals increased from small to medium to large fragments, with small fragments having an average mammal density ( 7.6 individuals/km 2) significantly lower than that of large fragments (20.9 individuals/km2). This trend was not significant when species that were extinct or absent in some fragments were excluded from the analysis. Shortage of food ( fruits) and predation by small cats ( Leopardus sp.) are the likely factors contributing to the demise of mammals, most of which are frugivores, in small fragments. Estimates of population sizes were on the order of several hundred to thousands of individuals for the large reserves, whereas comparable estimates for the other areas indicate a few hundred individuals for the medium-sized reserves and <100 individuals per species in the small reserves. The estimates provided here indicate that only Atlantic forest reserves of =\" src=\"/na102/home/ACS/blackwell/journals/entities/2265.gif\" align=absBottom border=020,000 ha can sustain viable populations ( N e 500 individuals) of the five species studied, which represent only about 14% of all medium-sized to large species of mammals known to be present in fragments of this size. Given that only about 20% of all protected areas remaining in the Atlantic forest are equal to or larger than this size, management measures are badly needed to improve mammal conservation in this biome.

    "abstract": "Visual activity after eye-opening influences feature map structure in primary visual cortex (V1). For instance, rearing cats in an environment of stripes of one orientation yields an over-representation of that orientation in V1. However, whether such changes also affect the higher-order statistics of orientation maps is unknown. A statistical bias of orientation maps in normally raised animals is that the probability of the angular difference in orientation preference between each pair of points in the cortex depends on the angle of the line joining those points relative to a fixed but arbitrary set of axes. Natural images show an analogous statistical bias; however, whether this drives the development of comparable structure in V1 is unknown. We examined these statistics for normal, stripe-reared and dark-reared cats, and found that the biases present were not consistently related to those present in the input, or to genetic relationships. We compared these results with two computational models of orientation map development, an analytical model and a Hebbian model. The analytical model failed to reproduce the experimentally observed statistics. In the Hebbian model, while orientation difference statistics could be strongly driven by the input, statistics similar to those seen in experimental maps arose only when symmetry breaking was allowed to occur spontaneously. These results suggest that these statistical biases of orientation maps arise primarily spontaneously, rather than being governed by either input statistics or genetic mechanisms."

    "abstract": "The visual capacity of the common barn owl (Tyto alba) was studied by quantitative analysis of the retina and optic nerve. Cell counts in the ganglion cell layer of the whole-mounted retina revealed a temporal area centralis with peak cell density of 12,500 cells/mm2 and a horizontal streak of high cell density extending from the area centralis into the nasal retina. Integration of the ganglion cell density map gave an estimated total of 1.4 million cells for the ganglion cell layer. Electron microscopy of a single, complete section of the optic nerve revealed a bimodal fiber diameter spectrum (modes at 0.3 and 0.9 microns; bin width = 0.2 microns), with diameters ranging from 0.15 microns (unmyelinated) to 6.05 microns (myelinated, sheath included). The total axon count for the optic nerve was estimated from sample counts to be about 680,000 axons (25% unmyelinated). Therefore, roughly half of the cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer do not send axons into the optic nerve. With certain assumptions, the data predict a visual spatial acuity for barn owls on the order of 8 cycles/degree, a value similar to the known behaviorally measured acuities of masked owls (10 cycles/degree) and domestic cats (6 cycles/degree)."

    "abstract": "Owing to the detrimental impacts of invasive alien species, their control is often a priority for conservation management. Whereas the potential for unforeseen consequences of management is recognized, their associated complexity and costs are less widely appreciated. We demonstrate that theoretically plausible trophic cascades associated with invasive species removal not only take place in reality, but can also result in rapid and drastic landscape-wide changes to ecosystems. Using a combination of population data from of an invasive herbivore, plot-scale vegetation analyses, and satellite imagery, we show how a management intervention to eradicate a mesopredator has inadvertently and rapidly precipitated landscape-wide change on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. This happened despite the eradication being positioned within an integrated pest management framework. Following eradication of cats Felis catus in 2001, rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus numbers increased substantially although a control action was in place (Myxoma virus), resulting in island-wide ecosystem effects. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight an important lesson for conservation agencies working to eradicate invasive species globally; that is, risk assessment of management interventions must explicitly consider and plan for their indirect effects, or face substantial subsequent costs. On Macquarie Island, the cost of further conservation action will exceed AU$24 million."

    "abstract": "FeLV was discovered 40 years ago and vaccines have been commercially available for almost two decades. So far, most FeLV pathogenesis and vaccine studies were conducted assaying parameters, such as virus isolation and antigen detection. Accordingly, regressive infection was characterized by transient or undetectable viremia, while persistent viremia is typically observed in cats with progressive infection. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, the spectrum of host response categories to FeLV infection was recently refined by investigating proviral and plasma viral RNA loads. Cats believed to be immune to FeLV infection were found to turn provirus-positive after virus exposure. Moreover, efficacious FeLV vaccines were found unable to prevent provirus-integration and minimal viral replication. Remarkably, no difference was found in initial proviral and plasma viral RNA loads between cats with different infection outcomes. Only subsequently, the infection outcome is associated with FeLV loads. FeLV provirus was found to persist for years; reoccurrence of viremia and disease development was observed in some cats. Thus, aviremic provirus-positive cats are FeLV carriers and, following reactivation, may act as an infection source. However, integrated viral DNA may also be essential for solid protection and long-lasting maintenance of protective immunity. In conclusion, real-time TaqMan PCR and RT-PCR assays are highly sensitive and specific. They yield a more sensitive measure for FeLV exposure than antigen detection, virus isolation or immunofluoresence assays. We recommend the use of real-time PCR assays to identify FeLV exposed cats, particularly in catteries, and investigate obscure clinical cases that may be FeLV-associated. The use of sensitive molecular methods will contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the FeLV pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "There are three species of neotropical cats for which the northern limit of their distribution reaches the border region of the U.S. and Mexico: the jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and jaguarundi (Herpailurus yaguarondi). Due to their low population densities, small total numbers, and secretive habits, all three species are difficult to observe. To ensure long-term survival for neotropical cats in the region, it is imperative to identify current distribution and status in the northern limits of their range. We assessed the status of three rare neotropical felids, the jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaruni), in the Chiricahua and Peloncillo Mountains of southeastern Arizona where recent sightings of all three species have taken place. Study techniques included interviews and collection of unpublished and published species-sighting records, which yielded data on all three carnivores. Although jaguars and ocelots historically have occupied southeastern Arizona, we found no-recent evidence of a resident, reproducing population. Recommendations are made regarding what measures are necessary to promote neotropical cat conservation in this region."

Fifteen cats were tested on their ability to retrieve an unreachable food treat in three different set-ups: (a) a single baited string, (b) two parallel strings where only one was baited and (c) two crossed strings where only one was baited. All cats succeeded at pulling a single string to obtain a treat, but none consistently chose the correct string when two strings were parallel. When tested with two crossed strings one cat chose the wrong string consistently and all others performed at chance level. There was no evidence that cats understand the function of the strings or their physical causality."

    "abstract": "Animal overpopulation including feral cats is an important global problem. There are many stakeholders involved in the feral cat debate over 'what to do about the problem', including those who consider them a nuisance, the public at risk from zoonotic disease, people who are concerned about the welfare of feral cats, those concerned with wildlife impacts, and the cats themselves. How best to control this population is controversial and has ranged from culling, relocation, and more recently 'trap neuter return' (TNR) methods. Data support the success of TNR in reducing cat populations, but to have a large impact it will have to be adopted on a far greater scale than it is currently practised. Non-surgical contraception is a realistic future goal. Because the feral cat problem was created by humans, concerted educational efforts on responsible pet ownership and the intrinsic value of animals is an integral part of a solution."

The most common effect of nicotine given intravenously in a dose of 2 mug/kg every 30 sec for 20 min was to cause desynchronization of the electrocorticogram, indicating cortical activation, and an increase in the release of cortical ACh.3. A larger dose given less frequently (4 mug/kg every min for 20 min) caused, in some experiments, an increase and in others a decrease in cortical activity. Such changes were accompanied respectively by an increase or decrease in cortical ACh output.4. The amounts of nicotine that affected the electrocorticogram and ACh release are probably similar to those absorbed by the cigarette smoker who inhales.5. The effects of nicotine on the electrocorticogram were transient, but the effects on ACh were prolonged. This suggests that at least two pathways are involved in the nicotine response."

There were 19 treatment failures; 11 cats had only local recurrence, 4 cats developed metastatic disease, 3 cats had local recurrence followed by metastasis, and 1 cat developed simultaneous local and distant disease. Twelve cats are alive and disease free. Two cats died without evidence of treatment failure. The presence of tumor cells at the margin of resected tissue after radiation was the only variable which influenced treatment success. The median (95% confidence interval) disease free interval in 5 cats with tumor cells at the margin of the resected specimen was 112 (94,150) days versus 700 (lower limit 328) days for 26 cats with negative tumor margins, p < 0.0001. We did not identify a relationship between tumor volume, number of prior tumor excisions, concomitant use of chemotherapy or various descriptors of the radiation therapy technique and disease free interval."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence of pituitary tumors, detectable by means of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, in cats with insulin resistance suspected to have acromegaly or hyperadrenocorticism versus cats with well-controlled diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: 16 cats with insulin resistance that were also suspected to have acromegaly (n = 12) or pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (4) and 8 cats with well-controlled diabetes mellitus. PROCEDURE: Computed tomography was performed on all 16 cats with insulin resistance and 2 cats in which diabetes mellitus was well-controlled. The remaining 6 cats in which diabetes mellitus was well-controlled underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Images were obtained before and immediately after i.v. administration of contrast medium. RESULTS: Computed tomography revealed a mass in the region of the pituitary gland in all 16 cats with insulin resistance. Maximum width of the masses ranged from 4.4 to 12.7 mm; maximum height ranged from 3.1 to 12.6 mm. Results of computed tomography performed on 2 cats with well-controlled diabetes and magnetic resonance imaging performed on the remaining 6 cats were considered normal. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that cats with insulin resistance suspected to have acromegaly or pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism are likely to have a pituitary mass detectable by means of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging."

    "abstract": "A retrospective study of 15 dogs and three cats was done to characterize the appearance of meningeal enhancement on magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain, and to correlate this appearance with its underlying cause. Two patterns of meningeal enhancement (pial and dural) were identified. Enhancement of the pia mater was evident in four dogs and one cat, while enhancement of the dura mater was seen in 11 dogs and 2 cats. A variety of causes of meningeal enhancement were identified, including bacterial and cryptococcal meningitis, plasmacytic meningitis with associated subdural fluid accumulation, granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, inflammation secondary to otitis interna, feline infectious peritonitis, and neoplasia. The present study confirms that pial or dural meningeal enhancement may be present on MR images of the brain of dogs or cats in association with a variety of central nervous system diseases. A larger prospective study is required to further establish the incidence of specific patterns of meningeal enhancement seen in association with specific diseases."

    "abstract": "This survey was conducted to investigate the presence of Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens in native dogs and cats living in an area of Italy where animal and human dirofilarioses have been sporadically reported in the past few years. From May 2008 to March 2009 individual blood samples were collected from 300 native cats and 300 native dogs in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. All 600 samples were subjected to a Knott modified method, to a test for the detection of circulating D. immitis antigen and to two species-specific PCR-coupled sequencing protocols. Epidemiological data were collected and then correlated with the filarial prevalence by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Twenty-five dogs (8.3%) and six cats (2%) were positive for filariae in at least one diagnostic test, with an overall prevalence rate for D. immitis and D. repens of 2.3% and 5.6% in dogs and 0.3% and 1.6% in cats, respectively. Male and large sized dogs resulted more likely to be infected by Dirofilaria spp., possibly due to the fact that animals living outdoor and of large size are more exposed to mosquito bites. However these factors were not confirmed as convincing risk factors by multivariate analysis. The results are discussed, together with the origin of these new autochthonous foci in central Italy and the present expansion southward of canine and feline filariae in Italy."

    "abstract": "Feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the oral cavity that causes severe pain and distress. There are currently no specific treatment methods available and little is known regarding its aetiology, although bacteria are thought to play a major role. The purpose of this study was to identify the oral bacterial flora in normal and diseased cats. Oral swabs were obtained from the palatoglossal folds of eight cats (three normal and five FCGS) and were subjected to microbiological culture. Pasteurella pneumotropica and Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida were the most prevalent species identified by culture methods in the normal and FCGS samples, respectively. Bacteria were also identified using culture-independent methods (bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing). For the normal samples, 158 clones were analysed and 85 clones were sequenced. Capnocytophaga canimorsus (10.8% of clones analysed) was the predominant species. Uncultured species accounted for 8.2% of clones analysed, and 43.7% of clones analysed represented potentially novel species. For the FCGS samples, 253 clones were analysed and 91 clones were sequenced. The predominant species was P. multocida subsp. multocida (51.8% of clones analysed). Uncultured species accounted for 8.7% of clones analysed, and 4.7% of clones analysed represented potentially novel species. It is concluded that the oral flora in cats with FCGS appears to be less diverse than that found in normal cats. However, P. multocida subsp. multocida is found to be significantly more prevalent in FCGS than in normal cats and consequently may be of aetiological significance in this disease."

    "abstract": "The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the human brain was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure patterns of response in ventral temporal cortex while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories of man-made objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of response was found for each stimulus category. The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate that the representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex are widely distributed and overlapping."

The results of blood examination were within the normal range, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and computed tomography (CT) scan in one cat did not show any abnormality. Despite therapy with diazepam (Valium; Roche) there was deterioration of the clinical signs and the cats were euthanased. The neuropathological examination revealed hippocampal necrosis that included the piriform lobe."

    "abstract": "Humans and animals detect low-level tones masked by slowly fluctuating noise very efficiently. A possible neuronal correlate of this phenomenon is the ability of low-level tones to suppress neuronal locking to the envelope of the fluctuating noise (\"locking suppression\"). Using in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings in cats, we studied neuronal responses to combinations of fluctuating noise and tones in three successive auditory stations: inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate body (MGB), and primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that although the most sensitive responses in the IC were approximately isomorphic to the physical structure of the sounds, with only a small perturbation in the responses to the fluctuating noise after the addition of low-level tones, some neurons in the MGB and all A1 neurons displayed striking suppressive effects. These neurons were hypersensitive, showing suppression already with tone levels lower than the threshold of the neurons in silence. The hypersensitive locking suppression in A1 and MGB had a special timing structure, starting >75 ms after tone onset. Our findings show a qualitative change in the representation of tone in fluctuating noise along the IC-MGB-A1 axis, suggesting the gradual segregation of signal from noise and the representation of the signal as a separate perceptual object in A1."

    "abstract": "1. Because predators threaten the survival of endangered prey in many places, predator management is a widespread conservation tool. At the same time, the effects of predators on their prey are greatly influenced by landscape structure. Therefore, the management of landscapes could be an alternative to predator regulation. 2. A spatially explicit presence/absence model (a stochastic one-layer cellular automaton) was used to investigate two different predator-prey systems that were subject to changes in the number and size of habitat patches in a model landscape. 3. The first scenario included grey-sided voles Clethrionomys rufocanus, Norwegian lemmings Lemmus lemmus and small mustelids (stoats Mustela erminea and weasels M. nivalis) interacting in a tundra landscape. In the second scenario, the effect of habitat perforation by human settlements with subsidized predators (house cats Felis silvestris catus) on the dynamics of lemmings (as surrogate for endangered prey) was studied. 4. Both the total area of lemming habitat and the degree of fragmentation were important determinants of the population size and persistence of lemmings. A qualitative change in the effect of fragmentation was observed when the area of lemming habitat decreased from 70% (positive effect) to 50% (negative effect). When lemming habitat covered 50% or less of the landscape, fragmentation had a negative effect on lemming population size and viability, even though habitat area did not decrease. 5. The spatial configuration of settlements as predator sources was important. A few evenly spaced predator sources had less negative effect on lemming populations than the same proportion of predator habitat that was randomly distributed, which in turn had less effect than many evenly spaced patches. 6. Including predator management in the model did not decrease the predators' negative impact on the population size and persistence of the endangered prey when settlements occurred in many small patches. 7. It is concluded that predator management is not a viable strategy to combat the threat to the survival of endangered prey, but that careful planning of landscape pattern could compensate for negative predation effects. The location and size of patches of predator habitat should be optimized in order to minimize the negative effects of predators visiting adjacent areas of natural habitat."

    "abstract": "Noradrenergic drugs, acting on alpha adrenoceptors, have been found to play an important role in the initiation and modulation of locomotor pattern in adult cats after spinal cord transection. There are at least two subtypes of alpha adrenoceptors, alpha1 and alpha2 adrenoceptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of selective alpha1 and alpha2 agonists in the initiation and modulation of locomotion in adult chronic cats in the early and late stages after complete transection at T13. Five cats, chronically implanted with an intrathecal cannula and electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were used in this study. Noradrenergic drugs including alpha2 agonists (clonidine, tizanidine, and oxymetazoline) and an antagonist, yohimbine, one alpha1 agonist (methoxamine), and a blocker, prazosin, as well as norepinephrine were injected intrathecally. EMG activity synchronized to video images of the hindlimbs were recorded before and after each drug injection. The results show differential effects of alpha1 and alpha2 agonists in the initiation of locomotion in early spinal cats (i.e., in the first week or so when there is no spontaneous locomotion) and in the modulation of locomotion and cutaneous reflexes in the late-spinal cats (i.e., when cats have recovered spontaneous locomotion). In early spinal cats, all three alpha2 agonists were found to initiate locomotion, although their action had a different time course. The alpha1 agonist methoxamine induced bouts of nice locomotor activity in three spinal cats some hours after injection but only induced sustained locomotion in one cat in which the effects were blocked by the alpha1 antagonist prazosin. In late spinal cats, although alpha2 agonists markedly increased the cycle duration and flexor muscle burst duration and decreased the weight support or extensor activity (effects blocked by an alpha2 antagonist, yohimbine), alpha1 agonist increased the weight support and primarily the extensor activity of the hindlimbs without markedly changing the timing of the step cycle. Although alpha2 agonists, especially clonidine, markedly reduced the cutaneous excitability and augmented the foot drag, the alpha1 agonist was found to increase the cutaneous reflex excitability. This is in line with previously reported differential effects of activation of the two receptors on motoneuron excitability and reflex transmission. Noradrenaline, the neurotransmitter itself, increased the cycle duration and at the same time retained the cutaneous excitability, thus exerting both alpha1 and alpha2 effects. This work therefore suggests that different subclasses of noradrenergic drugs could be used to more specifically target aspects of locomotor deficits in patients after spinal injury or diseases."

Information was retrieved from 419 prescriptions and 311 questionnaire sheets concerning antimicrobial treatment for feline patients. Infected wounds, skin disorders and urinary tract infections were the most common reasons for antimicrobial treatment in cats. Compliance with prudent use guidelines was good. beta-Lactams such as amoxycillin and amoxycillin with clavulanic acid were frequently used. Fluoroquinolones were used judiciously. The median length of treatment was 10 days for most conditions. Diagnosis was mainly based on clinical signs, and bacteriological culture and sensitivity testing was rarely performed. This study provides basic descriptive information on how antimicrobials are used in cats and that could help when revising guidelines for the condition-based use of antimicrobials in animals."

    "abstract": "The study was designed to determine urinary excretions of endogenous total, urea, ammonia and creatinine nitrogen in adult domestic cats. Endogenous urinary nitrogen metabolite excretions were determined by feeding adult cats a protein-free diet for 10 d or by regression to zero protein intake of the urinary nitrogen metabolite excretions of adult cats fed four levels of dietary protein. The mean (+/- SEM) endogenous total, urea and ammonia nitrogen excretions for the cats fed the protein-free diet were 360 (+/- 11.3), 243 (+/- 8.8) and 27.6 (+/- 1.06) mg x kg body weight(-0.75) x d(-1), respectively. Estimates of 316 (+/- 53.9), 232 (+/- 43.4) and 33.7 (+/- 5.68) mg x kg body weight(-0.75) x d(-1), respectively, were obtained using the regression technique. The differences in results between the two techniques were not statistically significant. Daily excretions of creatinine nitrogen were not significantly (P = 0.64) different between the protein-free and regression technique (mean +/- SEM, 14.4 +/- 0.49 and 15.9 +/- 1.05 mg/kg body weight(0.75), respectively). The endogenous urinary total and urea nitrogen excretion of adult domestic cats is higher than values for other mammals such as humans, dogs, rats and pigs."

    "abstract": "Although cats had been considered resistant to disease from influenza virus infection, domestic cats and large felids are now known to be naturally und experimentally susceptible to infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1). The virus causes systemic infection, lung and liver being the mainly affected organs. Infected cats show fever, depression, dyspnoea, and neurological signs, but subclinical infections have also occurred. Mostly, cats have been infected by direct contact with affected birds, especially by eating raw poultry; transmission from cat to cat may also occur. Little is known about the role of cats in the epidemiology of the virus. So far, no reassortment between avian and mammalian influenza viruses has occurred in cats, but experts fear that cats might give the virus an opportunity to adapt to mammals. This publication gives a review on avian influenza in cats with a focus on practical aspects for veterinarians. © 2008 ESFM and AAFP."

    "abstract": "Differentiating between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and small intestinal lymphoma in cats is often difficult, especially when only endoscopic biopsy specimens are available for evaluation. However, a correct diagnosis is imperative for proper treatment and prognosis. A retrospective study was performed using surgical and endoscopic intestinal biopsy specimens from 63 cats with a history of chronic diarrhea or vomiting or weight loss. A diagnosis of lymphoma or inflammation was based on microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections alone, HE-stained sections plus results of immunohistochemical labeling (IHC) for CD3e and CD79a, and HE staining, immunophenotyping, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for B and/or T cell clonality. In addition, various histomorphologic parameters were evaluated for significant differences between lymphoma and IBD using Fisher's exact test. The sensitivity and specificity of each parameter in the diagnosis of lymphoma were also determined. Results of Bayesian statistical analysis demonstrated that combining histologic evaluation of small intestinal biopsy specimens with immunophenotyping and analysis of clonality of lymphoid infiltrates results in more accurate differentiation of neoplastic versus inflammatory lymphocytes. Important histologic features that differentiated intestinal lymphoma from IBD included lymphoid infiltration of the intestinal wall beyond the mucosa, epitheliotropism (especially intraepithelial nests and plaques), heterogeneity, and nuclear size of lymphocytes. Based on the results of this study, a stepwise diagnostic algorithm that first uses histologic assessment, followed by immunophenotyping and then PCR to determine clonality of the lymphocytes, was developed to more accurately differentiate between intestinal lymphoma and IBD."

    "abstract": "The pantherine lineage of cats diverged from the remainder of modern Felidae less than 11 million years ago and consists of the five big cats of the genus Panthera, the lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard, as well as the closely related clouded leopard. A significant problem exists with respect to the precise phylogeny of these highly threatened great cats. Despite multiple publications on the subject, no two molecular studies have reconstructed Panthera with the same topology. These evolutionary relationships remain unresolved partially due to the recent and rapid radiation of pantherines in the Pliocene, individual speciation events occurring within less than 1 million years, and probable introgression between lineages following their divergence. We provide an alternative, highly supported interpretation of the evolutionary history of the pantherine lineage using novel and published DNA sequence data from the autosomes, both sex chromosomes and the mitochondrial genome. New sequences were generated for 39 single-copy regions of the felid Y chromosome, as well as four mitochondrial and four autosomal gene segments, totaling 28.7 kb. Phylogenetic analysis of these new data, combined with all published data in GenBank, highlighted the prevalence of phylogenetic disparities stemming either from the amplification of a mitochondrial to nuclear translocation event (numt), or errors in species identification. Our 47.6 kb combined dataset was analyzed as a supermatrix and with respect to individual partitions using maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference, in conjunction with Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees (BEST) which accounts for heterogeneous gene histories. Our results yield a robust consensus topology supporting the monophyly of lion and leopard, with jaguar sister to these species, as well as a sister species relationship of tiger and snow leopard. These results highlight new avenues for the study of speciation genomics and understanding the historical events surrounding the origin of the members of this lineage."

    "abstract": "The effects of thalamic sensory relay nucleus stimulation on the single neuron activity and field potentials within the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis, which is a trigeminal equivalent of the dorsal horn were investigated in intact cats as well as in cats subjected to retro-Gasserian rhizotomy 1-6 months before the experiments. Inhibition of nociceptive neural activity and a positive field potential were evoked by thalamic stimulation in the dorsal horn of the intact animals. A positive field potential followed double pulse stimulation with frequencies ranging up to approximately 50 Hz. The inhibitory periods ranged from 60 to 100 ms. Train pulse stimulation with frequencies ranging from 30 to 50 Hz produced long-lasting inhibition of nociceptive neural activity and a positive shift of the field potentials. Essentially identical inhibition of abnormal neural hyperactivity occurring in the rhizotomized dorsal horn was observed. The positive field potential corresponding to this inhibition also displayed characteristics similar to the field potential seen in the intact dorsal horn. These data indicate that the pathways involved in the inhibitory responses induced by thalamic sensory relay nucleus stimulation, unlike some other pain inhibitory systems, can exert their influence even to the dorsal horn which has undergone reorganization of neural circuits after rhizotomy."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary shape changes in skull and mandibular anatomy was analysed in 223 specimens of pantherine felids (Neofelis nebulosa, Panthera leo, Panthera onca, Panthera pardus, Panthera tigris, Panthera uncia) compared to a small-felid outgroup, consisting of 86 specimens of nine different species, using digital surface morphometry on 25 (skull) and 17 (mandible) landmarks. Shape evolution in the pantherine species is complex and nonlinear, and involves both large-scale and small-scale shape changes. Shape changes frequently differ among the ingroup species, but the four large Panthera species (leo, onca, pardus, tigris) bear some resemblance to each other. The leopard and jaguar bear the closest resemblance to each other, and several shape changes are common to the lion and tiger, but have probably evolved convergently as a result of large size. The lion has undergone the largest and most numerous shape changes from a small-felid outgroup. Certain shape changes in the skull and, in some respects, the mandible of the clouded leopard bear resemblance to those in the four large Panthera species. The snow leopard is often regarded as the most primitive of the extant Panthera, and skull and mandibular shape changes often diverge markedly from those observed in the other five ingroup taxa; its overall skull shape is rather similar to the small-felid outgroup. This indicates that the shape changes in the clouded leopard are convergent with those of the four large Panthera species. Landmark integration showed no significant correlation with molecular phylogeny, chiefly owing to the snow leopard being placed among the four large Panthera species. A traditional phylogenetic topology with the snow leopard as the basal-most species of Panthera yielded a weak but nonsignificant phylogenetic signal.

    "abstract": "Fleas are important arthropod vectors for a variety of diseases in veterinary and human medicine, and bacteria belonging to the genus Bartonella are among the organisms most commonly transmitted by these ectoparasites. Recently, a number of novel Bartonella species and novel species candidates have been reported in marsupial fleas in Australia. In the present study the genetic diversity of marsupial fleas was investigated; 10 species of fleas were collected from seven different marsupial and placental mammal hosts in Western Australia including woylies (Bettongia penicillata), western barred bandicoots (Perameles bougainville), mardos (Antechinus flavipes), bush rats (Rattus fuscipes), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), feral cats (Felis catus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). PCR and sequence analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and the 18S rRNA genes from these fleas was performed. Concatenated phylogenetic analysis of the COI and 18S rRNA genes revealed a close genetic relationship between marsupial fleas, with Pygiopsylla hilli from woylies, Pygiopsylla tunneyi from western barred bandicoots and Acanthopsylla jordani from mardos, forming a separate cluster from fleas collected from the placental mammals in the same geographical area. The clustering of Bartonella species with their marsupial flea hosts suggests co-evolution of marsupial hosts, marsupial fleas and Bartonella species in Australia. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although cortical contrast adaptation has been extensively studied with both psychophysical and electrophysiological techniques, little is known about retinal contrast adaptation in humans. METHODS: Retinal and cortical long-term contrast adaptation was assessed with simultaneous measurement of pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and cortical visual evoked potentials (VEPs). This study involved three approaches: sampling of the contrast transfer function from 2.7% to 98% with adaptation to high (98%) and low (7.3%) contrasts, linearity of adaptation effects, and transfer of contrast adaptation between parallel and orthogonal grating orientations. RESULTS: Contrast adaptation affected retinal and cortical recordings quite differently. The VEP showed a sigmoid contrast transfer function, which was shifted toward higher contrasts (by a factor of 1.9), whereas amplitudes at higher test contrasts were enhanced to 127%. The PERG decreased in amplitude to approximately 90%, and the latency was significantly reduced by 4 to 6 msec (P < 0.05). All measured effects were linear with adaptation contrast. Orientation played no role in the PERG results, whereas the VEP was enhanced to 125% when tested parallel and to 150% when tested orthogonal to adaptation. CONCLUSIONS: VEP results confirm and extend previous findings and fit well with single-cell recordings. The PERG findings suggest that retinal contrast adaptation occurs and mainly operates in the temporal domain, comparable to rapid gain-control findings in cats and primates."

    "abstract": "The sonographic features of intestinal mast cell tumors (MCT) were reviewed in 14 cats. The mean age was 13.4 ± 2.5 years. There were 16 focal intestinal tumors and one diffuse submucosal infiltrate. The most common pattern was focal, hypoechoic wall thickening that was noncircumferential and eccentric (9/16 tumors) or circumferential, asymmetric, and eccentric (5/16 tumors). Nine of the cats had lesions in the jejunum or duodenum, four were at the ileocecocolic junction, and one cat had a colonic mass. Six MCTs had altered but not loss of wall layering, and the most commonly affected layer on ultrasound examination was the muscularis propria. Nine cats had enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, and seven were due to metastatic disease. Metastatic disease was not routinely detected by ultrasound in the liver (1/4 cats) or the spleen (0/3 cats). Concurrent small cell (T cell) lymphoma was present in four of 14 cats (29%)."

Of 41 axons recovered in 4-5 week old kittens, three well-filled axons arborized in area 17; the remainder were incomplete or arborized in area 18. One axon had Y-like physiological properties, two were X-like. They were recovered from two 34-day-old kittens. All three axons formed clustered arborizations, mainly in layer 4A. Electron microscopic (EM) analysis of 50 boutons from kitten and 38 boutons from adult controls revealed that the boutons from kitten made synapses more frequently on spines (91% of targets) than did the boutons from the adult (71%). One X-like axon in kitten also had a collateral projection that made synapses in layer 1; this has not been seen in adult cats. In overall extent, the axons from kitten fell within the adult range."

The inoculum was prepared with embryonated eggs and orally administered to each individual animal through an esophagus probe. In parallel, 100 specimens of Felis catus domesticus were individually fed with 55-70 nodules containing 3rd-stage larvae encysted in tissues of infected rodents. Animals were examined and necropsied at different time intervals. the migration and encystment of L3 larva was observed in viscera, skeletal muscle, adipose and subcutaneous tissues from all rodents. Adult worms localized at abscesses in the cervical region, rhino, and oropharynx were recovered from domestic cats inoculated with infected rodent tissues. Through this study we can conclude that: (1) wild rodents act as intermediate hosts, characterizing this ascarid heteroxenic cycle; (2) in natural conditions rodents could possibly act as either intermediate hosts or paratenic hosts of Lagochilascaris minor; (3) despite the occurrence of an auto-infecting cycle, in prime-infection of felines (definite hosts) the cycle is only completed when intermediate hosts are provided; and (4) in the wild, rodents could serve as a source of infection for humans as they are frequently used as food in regions with the highest incidence of human lagochilascariasis."

    "abstract": "Eye movements can be broadly classified into target-selecting and gaze-stabilizing eye movements. How do the different systems interact under natural conditions? Here we investigate interactions between the optokinetic and the target-selecting system in cats and humans. We use combinations of natural and grating stimuli. The natural stimuli are movies and pictures taken from the cat's own point of view with a head-mounted camera while it moved about freely in an outdoor environment. We superimpose linear global motion on the stimuli and use measurements of optokinetic nystagmus as a probe to study the interaction between the different systems responsible for controlling eye movements. Cats display higher precision stabilizing eye movements in response to natural pictures as compared to drifting gratings. In contrast, humans perform similarly under these two conditions. This suggests an interaction of the optokinetic and the pursuit system. In cats, the natural movies elicit very weak optokinetic responses. In humans, by contrast, the natural movie stimuli elicit effectively stabilizing eye movements. In both species, we find a unimodal distribution of saccades for all stimulus velocities. This suggests an early interaction of target-selecting and gaze-stabilizing saccades. Thus, we argue for a more integrated view in humans of the different eye movement systems."

    "abstract": "The effect of MK-329, a potent, orally active, nonpeptidal cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist, was measured on the gastric emptying rate of a solid meal in cats. External scintigraphy of cats that had been fed a meal of technetium-99m-(99mTc) labeled rabbit liver and light cream allowed the measurement of the emptying rates of either the liquid or solid portion of a meal under physiologic conditions. In cats, liquids emptied 2.6 times faster than solids [163 +/- 11 min vs. 62 +/- 3 min (mean +/- s.e.)]. At 3 or 10 mg/kg p.o., MK-329 gastric emptying was significantly accelerated, with the mean half-time of emptying being decreased by 34 +/- 11% (mean +/- s.e.) of the control half-times (p less than 0.02). Using only responders (five of six animals), mean half-time was decreased by 55 +/- 4% of the control half-times. CCK is important in regulating the emptying of solid food from the stomach because the CCK antagonist MK-329 accelerates that emptying."

    "abstract": "The feeding habits of feral domestic cats Felis catus (n = 264), wild cats Felis silvestris (n = 22) and their hybrids (n = 30) were investigated in Hungary. Cat groups were identified taxonomically by morphological and molecular methods. Diet components were identified in stomach contents and faeces collected from the recta. In each cat group, abundant small mammals were dominant in the diet (relative frequency of occurrence: feral domestic cat, 61-82%, depending on regions; wild cat, 70%; hybrid, 59%). Birds were the second most important quarry (2-7%, 16% and 20%, respectively in the three cat groups), while the contribution of hares (1-2%, 5% and 3%, respectively) and other taxa was not significant. Every cat group preyed on small-sized animals (< 50 g; 89-96%, 80% and 80%, respectively), terrestrial (91-98%, 84% and 86%, respectively) and wild (71-73%, 87% and 77%, respectively) prey. Standardized trophic niche breadth was typically very narrow (B,4 = 0.07-0.16, 0.13 and 0. 17, respectively). Feral domestic cats occasionally consumed household food (2-7%) and domestic animals (4-8%). This could mean that feral domestic cats have an advantage over wild cats that are food specialists. The trophic niche overlap between cat groups was high (77-88%). Food composition and feeding habits, (weight, zonation and environmental association of consumed prey) of feral domestic cats, however, was different compared to wild cats, which indicated the possibility of partial resource partitioning. The values for hybrids were between the two groups. As well as the stable presence of feral domestic cats (mean population density, D = 1.34 individuals/ 1000 ha) based on field live-trapping, hybrids are also present (D = 0. 10), leading to continuous hybridization. This can threaten the population of wild cats, which are present at a low density (D = 0. 17)."

Ankle extension against a load was effected by neural stimulation through a dual channel intrafascicular electrode of a fascicle of the tibial nerve that innervated the gastrocnemius muscle. Ankle joint angle was estimated from recordings of tibialis anterior and lateral gastrocnemius spindle fiber activity made with dual channel intrafascicular electrodes. Experiments were conducted in neurally intact anesthetized cats and in unanesthetized decerebrate cats to demonstrate the feasibility of this system. The system was able to reach and maintain a fixed target ankle position in the presence of a varying external moment ranging in magnitude between 7.3 and 22 N-cm opposing the action of the ankle extensor, as well as track a sinusoidal target ankle position up to a frequency of 1 Hz in the presence of a constant magnitude 22- or 37-N-cm external moment."

    "abstract": "A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of Echinococcus multilocularis coproantigens (EM-ELISA) was developed with polyclonal rabbit (solid phase) and chicken egg (catching) antibodies that were directed against E. multilocularis coproantigens and somatic worm antigens, respectively. In experimentally infected dogs and cats, coproantigens were first detectable 6-17 days postinfection (PI) in samples of 8 dogs (worm burdens at necropsy: 6,330-43,200) and from 11 days PI onward in samples of 5 cats infected with 20-6,833 worms. After anthelmintic treatment of 4 dogs and 5 cats at day 20 PI, coproantigen excretion disappeared within 3-5 days. The sensitivity of the ELISA was 83.6% in 55 foxes infected with 4-60,000 E. multilocularis, but reached 93.3% in the 45 foxes harboring more than 20 worms. The EM-ELISA was used in surveys of \"normal\" dog and cat populations in Switzerland. Among 660 dogs and 263 cats, 5 dogs and 2 cats exhibited a positive reaction. In 2 of these dogs (0.30%) and 1 cat (0.38%), intestinal E. multilocularis infections were confirmed by necropsy, polymerase chain reaction PCR, or both. The specificites of the ELISA in these groups were found to be 99.5% and 99.6%, respectively, if positive ELISA results that could not be confirmed by other methods were classified as \"false positive\" reactions."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of the first investigations into the use of bipolar electrical stimulation of the retina with a suprachoroidal vision prosthesis, and the effects of different electrode configurations on localization of responses on the primary visual cortex. Cats were implanted with electrodes in the suprachoroidal space, and electrically evoked potentials were recorded on the visual cortex. Responses were elicited to bipolar and monopolar stimuli, with each stimulating electrode coupled with either six-return electrodes, two-return electrodes, or a single-return electrode. The average charge threshold to elicit a response with bipolar stimulation and six-return electrodes was 76.47+/-8.76 nC. Bipolar stimulation using six-return electrodes evoked responses half the magnitude of those elicited with a single or two-return electrodes. Monopolar stimulation evoked a greater magnitude, and area of cortical activation than bipolar stimulation. This study showed that suprachoroidal, bipolar stimulation can elicit localized activity in the primary visual cortex, with the extent of localization and magnitude of response dependent on the electrode configuration."

    "abstract": "This study explored the duration of cats' working memory for hidden objects. Twenty-four cats were equally divided into four groups, which differed according to the type of visual cues displayed on and/or around the hiding boxes. During eight sessions, the four groups of cats were trained to locate a desirable object hidden behind one of the four boxes placed in front of them. Then, the cats were tested with retention intervals of 0, 10, 30 and 60 s. Results revealed no significant differences between the groups during training or testing. In testing, the cats' accuracy to locate the hidden object rapidly declined between 0 and 30 s but remained higher than chance with delays of up to 60 s. The analysis of errors also indicated that the cats searched as a function of the proximity of the target box and were not subjected to intertrial proactive interference. This experiment reveals that the duration of cats' working memory for disappearing objects is limited and the visual cues displayed on and/or around the boxes do not help the cats to memorize a hiding position. In discussion, we explore why the duration of cats' working memory for disappearing objects rapidly declined and compare these finding with those from domestic dogs. The irrelevance of visual cues displayed on and around the hiding boxes on cats' retention capacity is also discussed."

    "abstract": "Standard recommendations as to how much to feed dogs and cats are based on the average requirements of unstressed healthy laboratory dogs and cats of normal body condition undertaking modest amounts of exercise in a thermoneutral environment, but most clinical patients do not conform to these norms. Most clinicians estimate the energy expenditure of patients using a factorial calculation that adjusts for any differences from the norm, but little information exists upon which to base these adjustments. Furthermore, individual variation in energy expenditure is substantial even in dogs and cats under closely defined physiological conditions, and the estimate of energy expenditure obtained by using a factorial calculation can differ by a substantial margin from the energy expenditure of an individual. Detailed dietary histories provide an estimate of individual energy requirements but are time consuming to perform and rely on several assumptions. There are also no readily available point-of-care methods for measuring the energy expenditure of dogs and cats. There is a need, therefore, for further research concerning factors that affect energy expenditure of dogs and cats and methods of measuring energy expenditure in individual patients."

    "abstract": "We investigated the presence and role of local inhibitory cortical control over synchronized thalamic inputs during spindle oscillations (7-14 Hz) by combining intracellular recordings of pyramidal cells in barbiturate-anesthetized cats and computational models. The recordings showed that 1) similar excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)/inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) sequences occurred either during spindles or following thalamic stimulation; 2) reversed IPSPs with chloride-filled pipettes transformed spindle-related EPSP/IPSP sequences into robust bursts with spike inactivation, resembling paroxysmal depolarizing shifts during seizures; and 3) dual simultaneous impalements showed that inhibition associated with synchronized thalamic inputs is local. Computational models were based on reconstructed pyramidal cells constrained by recordings from the same cells. These models showed that the transformation of EPSP/IPSP sequences into fully developed spike bursts critically needs a relatively high density of inhibitory currents in the soma and proximal dendrites. In addition, models predict significant Ca2+ transients in dendrites due to synchronized thalamic inputs. We conclude that synchronized thalamic inputs are subject to strong inhibitory control within the cortex and propose that 1) local impairment of inhibition contributes to the transformation of spindles into spike-wave-type discharges, and 2) spindle-related inputs trigger Ca2+ events in cortical dendrites that may subserve plasticity phenomena during sleep."

    "abstract": "The preoperative ultrasound images and biplanar operative mesenteric portograms of 28 dogs and six cats with congenital intrahepatic portacaval shunts were reviewed retrospectively. On the basis of the combined surgical, postmortem and imaging data, the shunts were classified according to their location within the liver and their shape. Thirteen dogs and four cats had a left-divisional shunt with a relatively consistent bent tubular shape that drained into the left hepatic vein. Another 13 dogs had a central-divisional shunt that took the form of a foramen between dilated portions of the intrahepatic portal vein and caudal vena cava. One cat with a central-divisional shunt had a tortuous vessel. The remaining two dogs and one cat had right-divisional shunts that were large, tortuous vessels. The morphology of a left-divisional shunt is compatible with patent ductus venosus, but the pathogenesis of central and right-divisional shunts is unknown. It is concluded that intrahepatic portacaval shunts in dogs and cats may be classified as left, central or right divisional. Ultrasound enables a preoperative morphological assessment that correlates well with the results of portography and may aid surgical planning."

    "abstract": "Earlier extracellular recordings during natural sleep have shown that, during slow-wave sleep (SWS), neocortical neurons display long-lasting periods of silence, whereas they are tonically active and discharge at higher rates during waking and sleep with rapid eye movements (REMs). We analyzed the nature of long-lasting periods of neuronal silence in SWS and the changes in firing rates related to ocular movements during REM sleep and waking using intracellular recordings from electrophysiologically identified neocortical neurons in nonanesthetized and nonparalyzed cats. We found that the silent periods during SWS are associated with neuronal hyperpolarizations, which are due to a mixture of K(+) currents and disfacilitation processes. Conventional fast-spiking neurons (presumably local inhibitory interneurons) increased their firing rates during REMs and eye movements in waking. During REMs, the firing rates of regular-spiking neurons from associative areas decreased and intracellular traces revealed numerous, short-lasting, low-amplitude inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), that were reversed after intracellular chloride infusion. In awake cats, regular-spiking neurons could either increase or decrease their firing rates during eye movements. The short-lasting IPSPs associated with eye movements were still present in waking; they preceded the spikes and affected their timing. We propose that there are two different forms of firing rate control: disfacilitation induces long-lasting periods of silence that occur spontaneously during SWS, whereas active inhibition, consisting of low-amplitude, short-lasting IPSPs, is prevalent during REMs and precisely controls the timing of action potentials in waking."

Representative extensor and flexor muscles that function at the hip, knee, and ankle joints were recorded, and in six spinal cats the kinematics of these joints were determined from high-speed cinefilm. The PSR was characterized uniquely by mixed (flexor-extensor) synergies. Knee extensor (VL) and ankle flexor (TA) coactivity constituted one synergy, while the second synergy included hip extensors (GM, BF), knee flexors (BF, LG), and ankle extensor (LG). Joint displacements reflected the mixed synergy. Motions at the knee and ankle were out of phase, while motions at the hip were in phase with movements of the knee. Electromyographic burst durations and onset latencies were similar for normal and spinal cats, and in all cycles of a given PSR, the recruitment pattern was consistent for all muscles, except VL. High variability and missing bursts marked the activity of VL in some spinal cats. In PSRs with missing VL bursts, oscillations at the knee joint were not coordinated with cyclic actions at the hip and ankle. From the kinematic records three distinct phases of the PSR were identified: start-up consisted of the initial four to six cycles during which hip, knee, and ankle actions progressively became organized; steady-state included the middle three to five cycles that were characterized by consistent displacement at all three joints; and slow-down comprised the last three to four cycles during which the rate of oscillations slowed, and joint excursions decreased. During steady-state cycles, muscle contractions acted to reverse joint motions at the knee and ankle joints. Thus, knee and ankle extensor recruitment coincided with joint flexion, while joint flexors were recruited during joint extension. Muscle activity at the hip, however, was in phase with displacement. While neural input to muscle is consistent throughout the three phases of the PSR, segment motions can become progressively organized during start-up to achieve stable oscillations. Whether the PSR attains steady-state or not may hinge on the sensitive interplay that occurs between muscle activities and intersegmental mechanical interactions. That kinetic interplay is detailed in the following paper."

    "abstract": "Pristine wilderness is a scarce global resource, but exotic species are so common that they constitute a principal component of worldwide ecological change. The relationship between these two topics, invasion and remoteness, was the impetus behind five years of fieldwork aimed at identifying the assemblage and range of exotic vertebrates in Cape Horn, Chile, identified as one of the world's most pristine wilderness areas. While the archipelago has extremely low human population density and vast tracts of undisturbed land, we discovered that several terrestrial vertebrate groups were dominated by exotic species. Native birds were diverse (approx. 154 spp), and only 1.3% (or two spp.) were introduced. In contrast, exotic terrestrial mammals (12 spp.) and freshwater fish (three spp.) outnumbered their native counterparts, constituting 55% and 75% of the assemblages. Using GIS, we found that not all areas were impacted equally, largely due to intensity of human occupation. Human settled islands (Navarino and Tierra del Fuego) hosted the greatest number of exotics, but humans alone did not explain observed patterns. Remote islands also had introduced species. North American beavers (Castor canadensis), American minks (Mustela vison) and feral domestic dogs and cats were particularly widespread, and their range in isolated parts of the study area raised important ecological and management questions. In conclusion, the Cape Horn Archipelago retained areas free of exotic vertebrates, particularly parts of the Cape Horn and Alberto D'Agostini National Parks, but at many sites introduced species were overwhelming native biota and altering these previously remote natural ecosystems. 2006 Springer."

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii infections in zoo animals are of interest because many captive animals die of clinical toxoplasmosis and because of the potential risk of exposure of children and elderly to T. gondii oocysts excreted by cats in the zoos. Seroprevalence of T gondii antibodies in wild zoo felids, highly susceptible zoo species, and feral cats from 8 zoos of the midwestern United States was determined by using the modified agglutination test (MAT). A titer of 1:25 was considered indicative of T gondii exposure. Among wild felids, antibodies to T gondii were found in 6 (27.3%) of 22 cheetahs (Acynonyx jubatusjubatus), 2 of 4 African lynx (Caracal caracal), I of 7 clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), I of 5 Pallas cats (Otocolobus manul), 12 (54.5%) of 22 African lions (Panthera leo), I of I jaguar (Panthera onca), I of I Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis), I of I Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor), 5 (27.8%) of 18 Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), I of 4 fishing, cats (Prionailurtis viverrinus), 3 of 6 pumas (Puma concolor), 2 of 2 Texas pumas (Puma concolor stanleyana), and 5 (35.7%) of 14 snow leopards (Uncia uncia). Antibodies were found in 10 of 34 feral domestic cats (Felis domesticus) trapped in 3 zoos. Toxoplasma gondii oocysts were not found in any of the 78 fecal samples from wild and domestic cats. Among the macropods, antibodies were detected in I of 3 Dama wallabies (Macropus eugenii), I of I western grey kangaroo (Macropus fidiginosus), I of 2 wallaroos (Macropus ro ustus), 6 of 8 Bennett's wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus), 21 (61.8%) of 34 red kangaroos (Macropus rufus), and I of I dusky pademelon (Thylogale brunii). Among prosimians, antibodies were detected in I of T blue-eyed black lemurs (Euleinur macaco flavifrons), I of 21 ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), 2 of 9 red-ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata rubra), and 2 of 4 black- and white-ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata). Among the avian species tested. 2 of 3 bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were seropositive. Among 7 possible risk factors, sex, freezing meat temperature (above - 13 C vs. below - 13 Q, washing vegetables thoroughly, frequency of feral cat sightings on zoo grounds (occasionally vs. frequently), frequency of feral cat control programs, capability of feral cats to enter hay/grain barn, and type of animal exhibit, exhibiting animals in open enclosures was the only factor identified as a significant risk (OR 3.22, P = 0.00)."

In most cases no underlying disease has been diagnosed prior to presentation with paresis/paralysis and profound anxiety. This article will review commonly used treatments for thromboembolism and agents proposed for prophylaxis. Many of the proposed treatments are themselves associated with a high morbidity rate and long term clinical trials are required to make comparative risk-to-benefit ratio assessments of these different options. In cats which do survive the initial treatment, clinicians are still faced with the perplexing problem of long term thrombus prevention, as a majority of cats have been shown to re-embolise despite prophylaxis"

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the activity of recombinant feline erythropoietin (rfEPO) in murine bioassays and evaluate its efficacy and safety in cats with erythropoietin-dependent nonregenerative anemia. ANIMALS: 26 cats (group 1, 19 cats with anemia attributed to chronic kidney disease [CKD]; group 2, 7 cats with CKD and recombinant human erythropoietin [rhEPO]-induced red cell aplasia [RCA]). PROCEDURE: The rfEPO was synthesized by use of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with feline erythropoietin complementary DNA. Preclinical assessments of rfEPO included an erythroid cell proliferation assay and measurements of reticulocytosis in Balb/C mice. Clinical assessments of cats included hematologic, biochemical, and clinical examinations during 12 (group 1) or 6 (group 2) months of rfEPO treatment. RESULTS: Biological activity of rfEPO was broadly equivalent to rhEPO in preclinical murine bioassays. Median Hct and absolute reticulocyte count in cats increased significantly during the first 3 weeks of rfEPO treatment, and median Hct generally could be maintained within a target range of 30% to 40% with periodic adjustments of rfEPO doses. Unexpectedly, 5 cats in group 1 and 3 cats in group 2 that initially responded to rfEPO treatment again developed anemia that was refractory to additional rfEPO treatments, even at higher doses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Treatment with rfEPO can reestablish active erythropoiesis in most cats with CKD, even those with anemia attributable to rhEPO-induced RCA. Unfortunately, development of RCA during treatment with CHO cell-derived recombinant erythropoietin proteins was not eliminated as a serious safety concern, even for this feline-specific preparation."

In two cats, intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy was associated with chronic enteritis. In the remaining two cats, intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy affected the intestinal tract proximal to stenosis due to alimentary lymphoma and an intestinal foreign body, respectively. Moderate increased thickness of the affected intestinal wall, measuring 7-8 mm, was evident on abdominal ultrasonographic examination of all subjects. In addition, the ultrasonographic five-layered feature of the intestinal wall was maintained, and only the muscular layer appeared thickened. Abdominal ultrasound allowed a presumptive diagnosis of intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy that was confirmed histologically in all cats."

    "abstract": "We mapped the topographic distribution of auditory responses in the posterior cerebellar vermis of the cat under barbiturate anesthesia. Auditory neurons in the granule cell layer of lobules VI and VII appeared to be arranged in columns perpendicular to the surface of the cerebellar cell layers. Mapping the surface of the cerebellum, auditory responses were found as separated patches of the order of a square millimeter. Neurons on these patches responded to auditory stimuli but neurons between patches did not respond to sound. In decerebrated cats, the entire granule cell layer within the cerebellar auditory area responded to acoustic stimulation without a patchy pattern. Responses to tonal stimuli from single neurons in the granule cell layer were studied before and after the induction of barbiturate anesthesia. Some neurons showed no change in their responses to sound before and under barbiturate. But other neurons showed dramatically attenuated responses or essentially stopped responding as a result of barbiturate anesthesia. These results suggest that there may be two types of granule cells distinguishable in their auditory responses and therefore possibly in function."

    "abstract": "A collection of 77 Staphylococcus intermedius isolates from dogs and cats in Switzerland was examined for resistance to erythromycin. Resistance profiles for 14 additional antibiotics were compared between erythromycin-resistant and susceptible isolates. A resistance prevalence of 27% for erythromycin was observed in the population under study. Complete correlation between resistance to erythromycin, and to spiramycin, streptomycin, and neomycin was observed. The erythromycin-resistant isolates all had a reduced susceptibility to clindamycin when compared to the erythromycin-susceptible isolates. Both constitutive and inducible resistance phenotypes were observed for clindamycin. Ribotyping showed that macrolide-aminoglycoside resistance was randomly distributed among unrelated strains. This suggests that this particular resistance profile is not related to a single bacterial clone but to the horizontal transfer of resistance gene clusters in S. intermedius populations. The erythromycin-resistant isolates were all carrying erm(B), but not erm(A), erm(C), or msr(A). The erm(B) gene was physically linked to Tn5405-like elements known as resistance determinants for streptomycin, streptothricin, neomycin and kanamycin. Analysis of the region flanking erm(B) showed the presence of two different groups of erm(B)-Tn5405-like elements in the S. intermedius population examined and of elements found in Gram-positive species other than staphylococci. This strongly suggests that erm(B) or the whole erm(B)-Tn5405-like elements in S. intermedius originate from other bacterial species, possibly from enterococci."

Clinical records were reviewed, and age, duration of neurologic illness, and clinical and histopathologic findings in cats with spinal cord disease were abstracted. Disease processes were classified into 7 categories and 23 groups. The most common diseases affecting the spinal cord of cats were feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), lymphosarcoma (LSA), and neoplasia of the vertebral column secondarily affecting the spinal cord. Information on age, onset and duration of clinical signs, and lesion localization at the postmortem examination in cats belonging to the 7 categories of disease were analyzed to create a practical list of differential diagnoses. Cats were also subcategorized into 3 groups based on their age at death. FIP was the most common disease of cats younger than 2 years of age. LSA and vertebral column neoplasia were the most common diseases affecting cats between 2 and 8 years of age. Vertebral column neoplasia was the most common disease affecting cats older than 8 years of age. Results of this histopathologic study showed that FIP and LSA were the most common disease processes affecting the spinal cord of cats. However, at least 21 other groups of diseases and their relative prevalence were identified."

    "abstract": "The cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) is the most common parasite of domestic cats and dogs worldwide. Due to the morphological ambiguity of C. felis and a lack of — particularly largescale — phylogenetic data, we do not know whether global C. felis populations are morphologically and genetically conserved, or whether human-mediated migration of domestic cats and dogs has resulted in homogenous global populations. To determine the ancestral origin of the species and to understand the level of global pervasion of the cat flea and related taxa, our study aimed to document the distribution and phylogenetic relationships of Ctenocephalides fleas found on cats and dogs worldwide. We investigated the potential drivers behind the establishment of regional cat flea populations using a global collection of fleas from cats and dogs across six continents. We morphologically and molecularly evaluated six out of the 14 known taxa comprising genus Ctenocephalides, including the four original C. felis subspecies (Ctenocephalides felis felis, Ctenocephalides felis strongylus, Ctenocephalides felis orientis and Ctenocephalides felis damarensis), the cosmopolitan species Ctenocephalides canis and the African species Ctenocephalides connatus. We confirm the ubiquity of the cat flea, representing 85% of all fleas collected (4357/5123). Using a multigene approach combining two mitochondrial (cox1 and cox2) and two nuclear (Histone H3 and EF-1α) gene markers, as well as a cox1 survey of 516 fleas across 56 countries, we demonstrate out-of-Africa origins for the genus Ctenocephalides and high levels of genetic diversity within C. felis. We define four bioclimatically limited C. felis clusters (Temperate, Tropical I, Tropical II and African) using maximum entropy modelling. This study defines the global distribution, African origin and phylogenetic relationships of global Ctenocephalides fleas, whilst resolving the taxonomy of the C. felis subspecies and related taxa. We show that humans have inadvertently precipitated the expansion of C. felis throughout the world, promoting diverse population structure and bioclimatic plasticity. By demonstrating the link between the global cat flea communities and their affinity for specific bioclimatic niches, we reveal the drivers behind the establishment and success of the cat flea as a global parasite."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of p53 overexpression in feline oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and to determine, if any, the association between p53 overexpression and lifestyle factors and environmental exposures, including exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Questionnaires concerning exposure to ETS and other environmental factors were sent to owners of cats presenting to the Harrington Oncology Program with a diagnosis of oral SCC between 1991 and 2000. Additionally, 23 formalin-fixed biopsy samples from these cats, with information regarding ETS, were evaluated immunohistochemically for p53 expression using the CM-1 clone and the avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase method. Of the 23 samples evaluated, 15 (65%) showed positive nuclear staining for the CM-1 clone. Tumor biopsy samples from cats exposed to any ETS were 4.5 times more likely to overexpress p53 than were tumors from unexposed cats (P = 0.19). Among cats with any ETS exposure, those with 5 years or longer of exposure were 7.0 times more likely to overexpress p53 (P = 0.38). Longhaired cats (P = 0.18) and female cats (P = 0.35) were also more likely to show p53 expression in their tumors. These results provide additional support for a relationship between oral SCC development and exposure to household ETS and may implicate p53 as a potential site for carcinogen-related mutation in this tumor."

Additional quantitative MR measures of myelination, cell swelling, gliosis, and neuronal loss may also be used for more specific characterization of lesions. These measures include magnetization transfer ratio, apparent diffusion coefficient, and the concentrations or ratios of metabolites identified by spectroscopy. Confidence that an MR abnormality is responsible for the clinical signs depends primarily on the degree of correspondence between the site of the lesion and the neuroanatomical localization."

    "abstract": "The increased prevalence of obesity after neutering in cats is problematic in veterinary practice. Although many factors seem to be involved, the role of prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), both implicated in adipose tissue development and glucose intolerance, should be considered. Seven male cats were castrated when 11 months old. Body weight was then recorded for 56 weeks and PRL, IGF-I and leptin assayed for 44 weeks. Body weight increased steadily but only significantly after 36 weeks. It stabilised after 44 weeks, and the cats then gained about 20% of their initial body weight. IGF-I increased rapidly and was significantly higher by week 3. PRL and leptin increased with initial peaks during the eighth and eleventh weeks, respectively. This study confirms that castration rapidly modifies the hormonal balance, partly explaining the body weight increase, and that hormonal changes precede this body weight increase. Hyperleptinaemia is apparently a consequence of excess weight."

    "abstract": "We examined the possibility that neurons or groups of neurons along the retino-cortical transmission chain have properties of tuned oscillators: To this end, we studied the resonance properties of the retino-thalamo-cortical system of anaesthetized cats by entraining responses with flicker stimuli of variable frequency (2-50 Hz). Responses were assessed from multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFPs) with up to four spatially segregated electrodes placed in areas 17 and 18. MUA and LFP responses were closely related, units discharging with high preference during LFP negativity. About 300 ms after flicker onset, responses stabilized and exhibited a highly regular oscillatory patterning that was surprisingly similar at different recording sites due to precise stimulus locking. Fourier transforms of these steady state oscillations showed maximal power at the inducing frequency and consistently revealed additional peaks at harmonic frequencies. The frequency-dependent amplitude changes of the fundamental and harmonic response components suggest that the retino-cortical system is entrainable into steady state oscillations over a broad frequency range and exhibits preferences for distinct frequencies in the theta- or slow alpha-range, and in the beta- and gamma-band. Concomitant activation of the mesencephalic reticular formation increased the ability of cortical cells to follow high frequency stimulation, and enhanced dramatically the amplitude of first- and second-order harmonics in the gamma-frequency range between 30 and 50 Hz. Cross-correlations computed between responses recorded simultaneously from different sites revealed pronounced synchronicity due to precise stimulus locking. These results suggest that the retino-cortical system contains broadly tuned, strongly damped oscillators which altogether exhibit at least three ranges of preferred frequencies, the relative expression of the preferences depending on the central state. These properties agree with the characteristics of oscillatory responses evoked by non-temporally modulated stimuli, and they indicate that neuronal responses along the retino-cortical transmission chain can become synchronized with precision in the millisecond range not only by intrinsic interactions, but also by temporally structured stimuli."

The general condition was unremarkable, but the kitten was considerably smaller than expected for the age and showed cataracts in both eyes. Serum glucose concentrations were persistently elevated and based on clinical findings and an elevated serum fructosamine concentration, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was established. Diabetes mellitus is not commonly diagnosed in young kittens, nor are cataracts recognised as a frequent feature of this disease in cats. The cataracts progressed in spite of the insulin therapy and the kitten was euthanised 10 weeks after referral. Histopathological examination of the pancreas revealed few and small islets of Langerhans compared to the examination of pancreas from a healthy kitten of the same age. Histopathological changes in the eyes included cataracts affecting both cortex and nucleus. © 2002 ESFM and AAFP. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Cardiopulmonary arrest was found to be more common than respiratory arrest in dogs and cats. Hospital discharge rates for animals with cardiopulmonary arrest ranged from 4.1% for dogs to 9.6% for cats, and were consistent with those reported from studies of human beings with cardiopulmonary arrest. Hospital discharge rates for dogs and cats with respiratory arrest were 28% and 58.3%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Visual cortical cells demonstrate both oscillation and synchronization, although the underlying causes and functional significance of these behaviors remain uncertain. We simultaneously recorded single-unit activity with microelectrode arrays in supragranular layers of area 17 of cats paralyzed and anesthetized with propofol and N(2)O. Rate-normalized autocorrelograms of 24 cells reveal bursting (100%) and gamma oscillation (63%). Renewal density analysis, used to explore the source of oscillation, suggests a contribution from extrinsic influences such as feedback. However, a bursting refractory period, presumably membrane-based, could also encourage oscillatory firing. When we investigated the source of synchronization for 60 cell pairs we found only moderate correlation of synchrony with bursts and oscillation. We did, nonetheless, discover a possible functional role for oscillation. In all cases of cross-correlograms that exhibited oscillation, the strength of the synchrony was maintained throughout the stimulation period. When no oscillation was apparent, 75% of the cell pairs showed decay in their synchronization. The synchrony between cells is strongly dependent on similar response onset latencies. We therefore propose that structured input, which yields tight organization of latency, is a more likely candidate for the source of synchronization than oscillation. The reliable synchrony at response onset could be driven by spatial and temporal correlation of the stimulus that is preserved through the earlier stages of the visual system. Oscillation then contributes to maintenance of the synchrony to enhance reliable transmission of the information for higher cognitive processing."

    "abstract": "Lymph nodes are essential structures to be evaluated in an ultrasonographic examination of the feline abdomen. It was hypothesized that current technical proficiency would allow all feline abdominal lymph nodes to be identified ultrasonographically. Ten clinically normal, adult, domestic shorthair cats were examined using real-time compound ultrasonographic imaging. The medial iliac lymph nodes were visible in 100% of the cats, the jejunal lymph nodes in 90%, the hepatic lymph nodes in 70%, the aortic lumbar, the splenic, and the pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes in 60% each, the ileocecal and the colic lymph nodes in 50% each, and the renal, the gastric, the sacral and the caudal mesenteric lymph nodes in 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10% of the cats, respectively. The inconsistent presence of lymph nodes, their poor echocontrast and interposed gas of the gastrointestinal tract explain the lower percentages of identification. The ultrasonographic length and diameter of the lymph nodes were determined. The majority of these measurements corresponded to those in the literature. We conclude that ultrasonography is a valuable tool for the identification and evaluation of most abdominal lymph nodes in the normal cat. Average ultrasonographic measurements are presented as a preliminary guideline for normal feline abdominal lymph nodes. ete"

    "abstract": "Nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 50 domestic cats (Felis catus) obtained from the Tsushima Islands were determined and the genetic diversity was analyzed. In the cats, six haplotypes of the complate cytochrome b sequences (1,140 base-pairs, bp) and ten haplotypes of the partial control region sequences (350 bp) were identified. Haplotypes obtained from both genes showed existence of at least 11 maternal lineages of domestic cats in Tsushima. Mean values of polymorphic site numbers and sequences differences in the control region were 2.4 times and 1.8 times higher that those in the cytochrome b gene, respectively. Our results support the idea that the evolutionary rate of the control region was faster than that of the cytochrome b as reported in other mammals. Molecular phylogenetic trees showed the similar clustering of haplotypes for both genes. Meanwhile, no individual variations within the Tsushima leopard cat (Felis bengalensis euptilura), which is native to Tsushima, were observed, possibly as as result of genetic drift in the small ancestral population by geographical isolation. In contrast, the diversity of the domestic cat population was higher than that of the leopard cats, because the genetic variability of the former's founders, which were repeatedly brought to Tsushima in the past, still remains. In addition, no sequences of the leopard cat mtDNA were detected in any domestic cats. However, because the possibility that the domestic cat would crossbreed with the leopard cat cannot be denied, genetic monitoring of two species is necessary to bilogical conservation in Tsushima."

Three cats were each fitted with a CatanDog's ® tag; the other three cats were not fitted with tags and served as controls. Following a 42-day acclimation period, each of the six cats was infested with 100, 1-3 day post-emergence, adult Ctenocephalides felis felis (Bouché) on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 27. Flea egg production was determined by collecting and enumerating eggs 2, 4 and 6 days after each infestation. Viability of eggs was determined by placing 100 eggs recovered from each cat in rearing media in an insect rearing chamber and determining adult emergence at 28 days. Adult fleas were recovered from cats 6 days post-infestation by thoroughly combing each cat to remove fleas. To determine if the tags provided protection from infestation, the six cats were placed into a 8.53 m×4.36 m room with 400 cat fleas for 3 h. Cats were then combed to remove and enumerate fleas. The CatanDog's ® tags had no significant effect upon egg production, egg viability, or adult fleas infesting cats. In addition there was no difference in the numbers of fleas recovered from the cats placed in the flea-infested room."

    "abstract": "Rabies in Grenada wildlife is at present almost exclusively confined to the mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, and it is currently estimated that 3??5% of the mongoose population is rabid. There have been 4 human deaths in the past decade, and most of the rabies in dogs, cats, and domestic livestock is thought to originate from mongoose bites. In 1971 over 11,000 dogs were vaccinated, and 25 people received antirabies treatment as a consequence of bites. Although rabies is not yet established in dogs, the presence of a large dog population poses a permanent threat, and dog vaccination campaigns and attempts at mongoose eradication have provided only temporary relief from an increasing problem. The history of rabies on the island up to the end of 1971 is considered, and the outlook for the future discussed. ?? 1972."

    "abstract": "The Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus is a known pathogen of birds. Only recently, the virus has been reported to cause sporadic fatal disease in carnivores, and its zoonotic potential has been dominating the popular media. Attention to felids was drawn by two outbreaks with high mortality in tigers, leopards and other exotic felids in Thailand. Subsequently, domestic cats were found naturally infected and experimentally susceptible to H5N1 virus. A high susceptibility of the dog to H3N8 equine influenza A virus had been reported earlier, and recently also HPAI H5N1 virus has been identified as a canine pathogen. The ferret, hamster and mouse are suitable as experimental animals; importantly, these species are also kept as pets. Experimental intratracheal and oral infection of cats with an HPAI H5N1 virus isolate from a human case resulted in lethal disease; furthermore, cats have been infected by the feeding of infected chickens. Spread of the infection from experimentally infected to in-contact cats has been reported. The epidemiological role of the cat and other pet animal species in transmitting HPAI H5N1 virus to humans needs continuous consideration and attention. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The use of transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) to evaluate the patterns and technique of measuring of left atrial appendage (LAA) flow velocities in normal cats. BACKGROUND: Left atrial enlargement and dysfunction are characteristic features of feline cardiomyopathy that may cause blood stasis in the left atrium (LA). This low flow state may be associated with hypercoagulability and thrombus formation. Left atrial enlargement, spontaneous echocardiographic contrast, and decreased velocity of LAA flow may be early indicators of thromboembolic risk. Little is known about the patterns and determination of LAA flow in normal cats. ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate LAA flow in 47 normal cats and to assess the effects of age, body weight, sex, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and echocardiographic indices of LA and LV size and function on LAA flow variables. RESULTS: Adequate LAA flow signals could be recorded in 43 (92%) cats. Polyphasic LAA flow profiles were obtained in all cats, consisting of two (79%), three (16%), or four (5%) flow waves. Maximum LAA flow velocity (mean+/-SD) was 0.47+/-0.20m/s (range 0.24-1.00) and average LAA flow velocity was 0.42+/-0.17m/s (0.22-0.93). There was a weak correlation between LAA flow velocity and LA size based on maximum LA diameter (r=0.36, p=0.018) and maximum LA area (r=0.44, p=0.004). There was no association between LAA flow velocity and any other independent variable evaluated. CONCLUSION: LAA flow may be recorded by use of TTDE in cats. The results of this study can be used for comparison with LAA flow patterns found in disease states."

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of physiological compensation that is seen in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian (PMLS) cortex of cats that received visual cortex (areas 17, 18, and 19) damage early in life. The strategy was to compare the response properties of PMLS neurons just after visual cortex damage (before any compensation has occurred) with the properties of PMLS neurons in normal cats and cats with long-standing visual cortex damage. Fourteen animals (aged 8 weeks, 18 weeks, 26 weeks, or adult) received a unilateral visual cortex lesion and recordings were made from ipsilateral PMLS cortex within about 24 h. An additional 4 adult cats were studied within either 24 or 3 h of a bilateral visual cortex lesion. Results from these animals were compared with results from normal cats and cats with long-standing visual cortex damage studied previously in this laboratory. At all ages studied, an acute visual cortex lesion reduced the percentage of direction-sensitive cells in PMLS cortex from nearly 80% in normal cats to about 20% after the lesion. In 8- and 18-week-old kittens, nearly all of the remaining PMLS cells responded best to stimulus movement but were not direction sensitive. In 26-week-old and adult cats, the remaining cells were divided between those that responded to movement without a directional preference and those that responded as well to stationary flashed stimuli as to moving stimuli. The presence of receptive-field surround inhibition was not affected significantly by an acute lesion at any age. In addition, few PMLS cells were orientation selective to elongated slits of light in cats with an acute lesion, just as in normal cats. The ocular dominance distributions of PMLS neurons also were normal following an acute visual cortex lesion at all ages studied. These results suggest that the influences of areas 17, 18, and 19 on the response properties of PMLS neurons are the same when the properties first reach maturity as in adult cats. The results also suggest that the mechanisms of physiological compensation for an early visual cortex lesion differ for different response properties. Compensation of direction sensitivity and orientation selectivity (an anomalous property) develops de novo after the early lesion. In contrast, compensation of ocular dominance appears to be due to the maintenance of a preexisting property that is present immediately after the lesion. Thus, plasticity after early visual cortex damage represents multiple developmental changes in the remaining visual pathways."

    "abstract": "This study was done to identify risk factors for obesity in an urban cat population in New Zealand. A door-to-door survey (conducted within the city limits of Palmerston North) obtained information on the diet, health and behaviour of 202 cats. One hundred and eighty-two of these cats were weighed and their back and leg lengths were measured. The interviewer's assessment of the body condition of each cat was the dependent variable used in this study. Variables that were identified as significant (p less than or equal to 0.1) following univariable analysis were grouped into one of the three models for stepwise logistic multiple regression (one each for cat characteristics, environmental and management variables and feeding variables). A combined logistic-regression analysis was performed on the significant variables identified from the three component models. In the combined model, only three variables were significant: the presence of dogs in a household (decreased odds of obesity), longer leg length and owners underestimating cats' body condition (both increased odds).

    "abstract": "Proteinuria was assessed in 100 randomly selected sick cats and 22 healthy cats by means of the urine protein:creatinine ratio, a traditional urine `dipstick' and a commercial ELISA-based dipstick designed to detect microalbuminuria (MA) semi-quantitatively. In addition the repeatability and reproducibility of the MA test was assessed by comparing results of five replicate tests of 26 urine samples, interpreted by two different readers. Discrepancies existed in the replicate test result in 23 and 27% of the samples examined by reader 1 and 2, respectively, and on several occasions this discrepancy was between whether the sample was `positive' or `negative' for MA. The inter-reader agreement was good ([kappa] = 0.75), but again discrepancies were noted and part of the reason for these problems appeared to be the necessary subjectivity in the interpretation of colour changes when reading test results. Proteinuria was significantly (P <= 0.014) more prevalent in the sick than the healthy cats with 36 and 9%, respectively, having detectable MA, 34 and 5%, respectively, having a urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio >0.5, and 84 and 9%, respectively, having positive urine protein dipstick analysis. There was a moderate significant correlation between UPC ratio and MA concentrations (rs = 0.68, P < 0.0001). While 13/87 cats with a UPC ratio <=0.5 had positive MA results, 10/84 cats with negative MA results had a UPC ratio >0.5, and none of these had evidence of lower urinary tract disease. This study confirmed that MA and proteinuria are commonly seen in cats with a variety of diseases, but they are not necessarily both elevated, and the UPC ratio can be elevated without an increase in MA results. Furthermore, some repeatability problems were demonstrated with the semi-quantitative MA test. These findings demonstrate that the semi-quantitative MA test should not be relied on as the sole determinant of proteinuria."

The proportion of consults where prescribing of antibacterials was identified was 35.1 per cent for dogs, 48.5 per cent for cats and 36.6 per cent for rabbits. Within this population, 76 per cent of antibacterials prescribed were β-lactams, including the most common group of clavulanic acid-potentiated amoxicillin making up 36 per cent of the antibacterials prescribed. Other classes included lincosamides (9 per cent), fluoroquinolones and quinolones (6 per cent) and nitroimidazoles (4 per cent). Vancomycin and teicoplanin (glycopeptide class), and imipenem and meropenem (β-lactam class) prescribing was not identified. Prescribing behaviour varied between practices. For dogs and cats, the proportion of consults associated with the prescription of antibacterials ranged from 0.26 to 0.55 and 0.41 to 0.73, respectively."

    "abstract": "PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Improvements in general health care and nutrition have meant that more cats are living to an advanced age. Weight loss is one of the most common presenting signs in the older cat. Many causes of weight loss in older cats are at least amenable to supportive care and some are curable. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Weight loss is a non-specific change and, while often a sensitive indicator of ill health, does not readily point to the diagnosis. Careful history taking and physical examination may indicate a specific cause but, as discussed in this article, further tests are generally required to confirm the diagnosis. In those cats where common causes of weight loss have been eliminated by initial tests, it is often harder to reach a diagnosis. A logical approach to case-solving is required, making use of imaging and advanced laboratory tests. Occult gastrointestinal disease should be suspected and investigated in cats where another cause of weight loss cannot be found. PATIENT GROUP: While the average lifespan of a pet cat is probably around 13-14 years, many will live longer than this if well cared for, and some considerably longer. Recently, the life stages have been redefined to help predict the changes that might be occurring in terms of a cat's physical and mental health. Cats are considered 'senior' at 11-14 years old and 'geriatric' at 15 years and above. AUDIENCE: Geriatric medicine is forming an increasing part of the case load of first opinion and many referral veterinarians."

    "abstract": "Gonadectomy predisposes domestic cats to undesired body weight gain and obesity. The disturbance responsible for this disregulation of energy balance has not been clearly identified. Energy intake and expenditure, body composition and plasma concentrations of leptin, insulin, glucose and triacylglycerol were determined during a 36-wk period in adult male (2-5 y) gonadectomized (n = 8) and intact (n = 8) normal cats and gonadectomized (n = 8) and intact (n = 8) lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-deficient cats. Cats were housed individually in temperature- and light-controlled rooms and continuously provided a commercial dry-type diet. In normal and LPL-deficient cats, body weight increased (P < 0.05) after gonadectomy by 27 to 29%, mostly as a result of fat accretion. There was a rapid increase (P < 0.05) in food intake of approximately 12% after gonadectomy of normal and LPL-deficient cats. The metabolic rate (kJ.kg(-1).d(-1)), determined in normal intact (319 +/- 20, n = 5) and gonadectomized (332 +/- 36, n = 5) cats, did not differ after gonadectomy. After gonadectomy, plasma concentrations of glucose and triacylglycerol did not change, whereas plasma insulin and leptin concentrations increased (P < 0.05), but not coincidentally with body weight gain. A stair-step increase in energy intake, and not decreased energy expenditure, appears to drive the weight gain associated with gonadectomy. Body fat mass appears to increase until the energy intake supports no further expansion. Adiposity signaling through insulin or leptin does not appear to mediate the energy intake effect. LPL deficiency did not preclude development of the overweight body condition. Therefore, gonadectomy-induced weight gain in cats is not a result of changed adipose LPL activity, as previously suggested."

    "abstract": "Differential distribution and phosphorylation of tau proteins were studied in developing kitten brain by using several antibodies, and was compared to phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease. Several antibodies demonstrated the presence of phosphorylated tau proteins during kitten brain development and identified pathological structures in human brain tissue. Antibody AD2, recognized tau in kittens and adult cats, but reacted in Alzheimer's tissue only with a pathological tau form. Antibody AT8 was prominent in developing kitten neurons and was found in axons and dendrites. After the first postnatal month this phosphorylation type disappeared from axons. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of kitten tau with alkaline phosphatase abolished immunoreactivity of AT8, but not that of AD2, pointing to a protection of the AD2 epitope in cats. Tau proteins during early cat brain development are phosphorylated at several sites that are also phosphorylated in paired helical filaments during Alzheimer's disease. In either event, phosphorylation of tau may play a crucial role to modulate microtubule dynamics, contributing to increased microtubule instability and promoting growth of processes during neuronal development or changing dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton and contributing to the formation of pathological structures in neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Although domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) possess an otherwise functional sense of taste, they, unlike most mammals, do not prefer and may be unable to detect the sweetness of sugars. One possible explanation for this behavior is that cats lack the sensory system to taste sugars and therefore are indifferent to them. Drawing on work in mice, demonstrating that alleles of sweet-receptor genes predict low sugar intake, we examined the possibility that genes involved in the initial transduction of sweet perception might account for the indifference to sweet-tasting foods by cats. We characterized the sweet-receptor genes of domestic cats as well as those of other members of the Felidae family of obligate carnivores, tiger and cheetah. Because the mammalian sweet-taste receptor is formed by the dimerization of two proteins (T1R2 and T1R3; gene symbols Tas1r2 and Tas1r3), we identified and sequenced both genes in the cat by screening a feline genomic BAC library and by performing PCR with degenerate primers on cat genomic DNA. Gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR of taste tissue, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. The cat Tas1r3 gene shows high sequence similarity with functional Tas1r3 genes of other species. Message from Tas1r3 was detected by RT-PCR of taste tissue. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that Tas1r3 is expressed, as expected, in taste buds. However, the cat Tas1r2 gene shows a 247-base pair microdeletion in exon 3 and stop codons in exons 4 and 6. There was no evidence of detectable mRNA from cat Tas1r2 by RT-PCR or in situ hybridization, and no evidence of protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Tas1r2 in tiger and cheetah and in six healthy adult domestic cats all show the similar deletion and stop codons. We conclude that cat Tas1r3 is an apparently functional and expressed receptor but that cat Tas1r2 is an unexpressed pseudogene. A functional sweet-taste receptor heteromer cannot form, and thus the cat lacks the receptor likely necessary for detection of sweet stimuli. This molecular change was very likely an important event in the evolution of the cat's carnivorous behavior."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:To determine the infectivity and transmissibility of Hendra virus (HeV).\\n\\nDESIGN:A disease transmission study using fruit bats, horses and cats.\\n\\nPROCEDURE:Eight grey-headed fruit bats (Pteropus poliocephalus) were inoculated and housed in contact with three uninfected bats and two uninfected horses. In a second experiment, four horses were inoculated by subcutaneous injection and intranasal inoculation and housed in contact with three uninfected horses and six uninfected cats. In a third experiment, 12 cats were inoculated and housed in contact with three uninfected horses. Two surviving horses were inoculated at the conclusion of the third experiment: the first orally and the second by nasal swabbing. All animals were necropsied and examined by gross and microscopic pathological methods, immunoperoxidase to detect viral antigen in formalin-fixed tissues, virus isolation was attempted on tissues and SNT and ELISA methods were used to detect HeV-specific antibody.\\n\\nRESULTS:Clinical disease was not observed in the fruit bats, although six of eight inoculated bats developed antibody against HeV, and two of six developed vascular lesions which contained viral antigen. The in-contact bats and horses did not seroconvert. Three of four horses that were inoculated developed acute disease, but in-contact horses and cats were not infected. In the third experiment, one of three in-contact horses contracted disease. At the time of necropsy, high titres of HeV were detected in the kidneys of six acutely infected horses, in the urine of four horses and the mouth of two, but not in the nasal cavities or tracheas.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:Grey-headed fruit bats seroconvert and develop subclinical disease when inoculated with HeV. Horses can be infected by oronasal routes and can excrete HeV in urine and saliva. It is possible to transmit HeV from cats to horses. Transmission from P poliocephalus to horses could not be proven and neither could transmission from horses to horses or horses to cats. Under the experimental conditions of the study the virus is not highly contagious."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melatonin has been proposed as a neuroprotective agent on the basis of its ability to function as a free radical scavenger, provided that lipoperoxidation and other free radical damage induced by reactive oxygen species resulting from cerebral ischemia are relevant pathophysiologic processes of ischemic neuronal damage. METHODS: The effects of melatonin or vehicle on neurologic deficit scores (Todd scale; maximal deficit score = 100, daily during 7 days after the ischemic episode) and neuronal population of hippocampal CA1-CA4 fields (cresyl violet stain, at the eighth day after the ischemic episode) were evaluated in adult male cats subjected to a 15-min period of acute global cerebral ischemia induced by cardiorespiratory arrest, and in cats subjected to a sham procedure. Continuous intravenous (iv) administration of either melatonin 10 mg/kg/h in 10% ethanol in saline or the vehicle alone (3 mL/kg/h) for 6 h starting 30 min after the end of the period of global cerebral ischemia was used as treatment. RESULTS: Global cerebral ischemia resulted in a severe loss of neurons in hippocampal CA1-CA4 fields (9, 13, 30 and 28% remaining neurons, respectively) of ischemic vehicle-treated cats in comparison with sham cats (100%). By contrast, remaining neurons in these regions were between 81 and 100% in the ischemic melatonin-treated cats, values that are nonsignificantly different as compared with sham cats. Values of remaining neurons in CA1-CA4 fields in ischemic melatonin-treated cats were significantly higher than those in ischemic vehicle-treated cats. Neurologic deficit scores in ischemic vehicle-treated cats (42-77 at day 1, 6-39 at day 7) were significantly higher than those in ischemic melatonin-treated cats (16-38 at day 1, 0-6 at day 7) on the days after the ischemic episode. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results support the neuroprotective effect of melatonin against the neuronal cerebral damage induced by acute global cerebral ischemia."

    "abstract": "In three rural villages of northwest Argentina, the overall proportion of domiciliary Triatoma infestans infected with Trypanosoma cruzi was 49% among 1,316 bugs individually examined for infection in March and October 1992). Most of the variation among individual households in the proportion of infected triatomines was explained by variations among houses in the proportion of bugs that fed on dogs or cats, the prevalence of infected dogs or cats, and the proportion of bugs that fed on humans, according to a logistic multiple regression analysis. The effects of human infection rates on bug infection rates were not statistically significant. After adjusting for the effects of other predictors, the presence of chickens in bedroom areas had negative and significant effects on the proportion of infected Triatoma infestans, and positive and significant effects on the number of T. cruzi-infected triatomines collected per person-hr per house. Dog or cat infection rates and the proportion of bugs that fed on dogs or cats and on chickens explained 80% of the total variance of infected-bug numbers in a linear multiple regression model. This is the first study to use detailed field data to show that variations in triatomine infection rates depend on bug host feeding patterns and dog or cat infection rates, while the presence of chickens in bedroom areas exerts opposite effects on the proportion and number of infected triatomines. Domestic animals play a crucial role in the domiciliary transmission of T. cruzi."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol for diuretic renal scintigraphy (renography) in cats and describe normal findings. 99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy was performed twice in 10 healthy cats. Furosemide or saline were injected 4.5 min after radiopharmaceutical administration for the diuretic or control scan, respectively. A dynamic acquisition was performed for 8 min. The following parameters were evaluated: (1) global and individual glomerular filtration rate (GFR); (2) shape of the time-activity curve (TAC); (3) time of peak (TOP); (4) individual kidney excretion half-time (T1/2) of the radiopharmaceutical; (5) percentage of maximum activity measured at the end of the study. Global GFR in the control studies (2.79 +/- 0.83 ml/min/kg, mean +/- SD) did not differ significantly from the diuretic scans (2.34 +/- 0.51 ml/min/kg). The shape of most (16/ 20) TAC of diuretic renograms was similar to those of control renograms. The TOP of the diuretic renogram curves was 3.06 +/- 0.58 min, and did not differ from that of the control scans (3.01 +/- 0.61 min). T1/2 of the diuretic renograms was significantly shorter (5.15 +/- 0.83 min) than that of the control renograms (6.31 +/- 1.50 min). A significantly lower percentage of maximum activity was present at the end of the study in diuretic renograms (median: 47.25%; range: 33.60-59.60%) compared with control renograms (63.40%; 30.00-69.40%). Diuretic renal scintigraphy is a noninvasive and fast procedure to perform in cats. The applicability of this technique needs to be investigated in patients with significantly impaired renal function and obstructive uropathies."

    "abstract": "We studied the encoding of stimulus orientation in the visual cortex of alert animals using information theory methods. Based on a labeled-line code, the encoding of orientation was mostly synergistic and only few pairs coded redundant. The synergy contributed about 20% of the information and was strongest for sites with distinct tuning curves. A recently proposed decomposition of synergy revealed that redundancy introduced by common tuning preferences is more than just compensated by noise correlations which mostly contributed synergistically. Based on a pooled response code, the contribution of noise correlations diminished resulting in a severe information loss. Thus, to operate economically, cortical neurons should either employ a labeled-line code or, if using pooled responses, be highly selective in choosing afferents."

    "abstract": "An 8-yr-old female paca (Agouti paca) was admitted at the Veterinary Hospital of the Belo Horizonte Zoo (Brazil) with an ulcerated cutaneous nodule of approximately 1.5 cm in diameter in the left ear. One week later, other cutaneous nodules were detected in various body locations. The animal died during a surgical procedure to remove the tumors. All cutaneous nodules were histologically similar with features of squamous cell carcinoma. Considering the predominant in situ nature of the lesion as well as its multicentric localization, the disease reported here closely resembles Bowen's disease, which has been described in humans and which has been identified as a rare neoplastic disease of cats, with one single report in a dog. This is the first report of a neoplastic disease in Agouti paca."

    "abstract": "To investigate how socialization can affect the types and characteristics of vocalization produced by cats, feral cats (n=25) and house cats (n=13) were used as subjects, allowing a comparison between cats socialized to people and non-socialized cats. To record vocalization and assess the cats' responses to behavioural stimuli, five test situations were used: approach by a familiar caretaker, by a threatening stranger, by a large doll, by a stranger with a dog and by a stranger with a cat. Feral cats showed extremely aggressive and defensive behaviour in most test situations, and produced higher call rates than those of house cats in the test situations, which could be attributed to less socialization to other animals and to more sensitivity to fearful situations. Differences were observed in the acoustic parameters of feral cats in comparison to those of house cats. The feral cat produced significantly higher frequency in fundamental frequency, peak frequency, 1st quartile frequency, 3rd quartile frequency of growls and hisses in agonistic test situations. In contrast to the growls and hisses, in meow, all acoustic parameters like fundamental frequency, first formant, peak frequency, 1st quartile frequency, and 3rd quartile frequency of house cats were of significantly higher frequency than those of feral cats. Also, house cats produced calls of significantly shorter in duration than feral cats in agonistic test situations. These results support the conclusion that a lack of socialization may affect usage of types of vocalizations, and the vocal characteristics, so that the proper socialization of cat may be essential to be a suitable companion house cat."

While ETEC and EHEC strains were not found, 15 EPEC strains were isolated from 14 cats, of which 13 were non-diarrhoeic, and one diarrhoeic. None of 15 EPEC strains carried the bfpA gene or the EPEC adherence factor plasmid, indicating atypical EPEC types. The EPEC strains were heterogeneous with regard to intimin types, such as eae-θ (three strains), eae-κ (n = 3), eae-α1 (n = 2), eae-α (n = 2), one eae-α2, eae-β1 and eae-ε each, and two were not typeable. The majority of the EPEC isolates adhered to HEp-2 cells in a localized adherence-like pattern and were positive for fluorescence actin staining. The EPEC strains belonged to 12 different serotypes, including O111:H25 and O125:H6, which are known to be pathogens in humans. Multi locus sequence typing revealed a close genetic similarity between the O111:H25 and O125:H6 strains from cats, dogs and humans. Our results show that domestic cats are colonized by EPEC, including serotypes previously described as human pathogens. As these EPEC strains are also isolated from humans, a cycle of mutual infection by EPEC between cats and its households cannot be ruled out, though the transmission dynamics among the reservoirs are not yet understood clearly. © 2008 Blackwell Verlag."

In cats anesthetized with N2O-O2, MAP decreased briefly (P less than 0.01) and then returned to the initial level within a minute after the i.v. injection of lidocaine (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg). RSNA increased at first and then decreased slightly. In cats with denervated baroreceptors, the change in RSNA after lidocaine 5 mg/kg i.v. was similar to that in cats with intact baroreceptors. In contrast, MAP, HR and RSNA decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) after i.v. injection of lidocaine during N2O-O2-halothane anesthesia. The effects of bupivacaine on RSNA were similar to those of lidocaine. It is concluded that cardiovascular depression following intravenous local anesthetics during N2O-O2-halothane anesthesia may be caused by both a decreased sympathetic activity and a direct depressant effect on the myocardium."

Information was also gathered on the background diet of the house cats (individually) and of each farm cat colony. Consistent differences were found between the predefined groups of cats in their preferences for three foods, Hard Dry (HD), Canned Meat (CM) and Raw Beef (RB), the greatest differences being between house cats and farm cats as a whole. The three colonies of farm cats showed distinct differences in preference, for RB and/or CM, and for the sixth food, Soft Dry (SD). Differences between farms could be explained by a reduced preference for items similar to major components of the background diet of each colony, i.e. selection in favour of foods that were temporally rare. Differences between house and farm cats, and within the house cats, could not be explained in this way; the house cats were neophobic towards RB, and the farm cats ate little of the HD food, possibly because they found it difficult to ingest."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the ultrasonographic appearance of biliary cystadenomas in cats and compare the findings to a similar rare form of liver tumor in humans. Biliary cystadenomas are uncommon, benign liver tumors of older cats that may occur as focal or multifocal cystic lesions within the liver. The records of 10 cats which had abdominal ultrasonography and histologic diagnosis of biliary cystadenoma were reviewed. The average age of affected cats was 13.3 years (range 10-16 years). Eight cats were neutered males and two were neutered females. In three cats, the tumors were not seen ultrasonographically due to their small size or from being obscured by near-field reverberation echoes. The remaining seven cats had solitary (4 cats) or multifocal (3 cats) masses corresponding to variable ultrasonographic patterns: multilocular masses containing thin-walled cysts, hyperechoic masses with cystic components, or masses of mixed echogenicity with cystic components. The masses had variable ultrasonographic patterns when multifocal disease was present. Recognizable cysts were evident somewhere within the tumors seen ultrasonographically, although sometimes the cysts appeared very small. The biliary cystadenomas were thought to be clinically silent. Although liver enlargement or a cranial abdominal mass was palpable in 4 cats, no consistent trend of clinical signs, CBC or serum biochemical abnormalities could be directly attributed to biliary cystadenoma. The treatment of choice is surgical resection of the tumor, as continued growth may compress adjacent vital structures within the liver. The differential diagnosis of biliary cystadenomas from other cystic liver lesions such as hepatic cysts, hematomas, abscesses, parasitic cysts, or other liver tumors is discussed."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) during anaesthesia in the kitten when using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or an endotracheal tube (ET). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized cross-over experimental study. ANIMALS: Forty Domestic Short Hair laboratory cats, 19 females and 21 males, aged 12-15 weeks and weighing 0.57-1.73 kg (mean 1.13 +/- SD 0.26). METHODS: Kittens were anaesthetized twice, once using the LMA and once the ET. Following induction of anaesthesia with isoflurane in an anaesthetic chamber and intubation of the trachea with the ET or placement of the LMA, a pH-electrode was introduced into the lower oesophagus. Monitoring of the oesophageal pH was performed for 45 minutes while anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. At the end of the experiment, gastric pH was measured. Kittens that had GOR during the experiment were treated with sucralfate, cisapride and ranitidine for 15 days. Results Oesophageal pH was 6.51 +/- 0.76 and gastric pH was 1.54 +/- 0.59. GOR was observed in nine kittens when the ET was used, and in 20 kittens when the LMA was used, the difference being significant (p = 0.013). The refluxate nearly always was acidic, being alkaline in only one kitten. Most of the GOR episodes occurred shortly after induction of anaesthesia and the oesophageal pH remained below 4.0 until the end of the experiment. No regurgitation was observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of the LMA is associated with an increased incidence of GOR during anaesthesia in the kitten, which is not detected by observation. That this may have occurred should be considered if the kitten demonstrates signs of oesophagitis in the postoperative period."

    "abstract": "The efficient-coding hypothesis asserts that neural and perceptual sensitivity evolved to faithfully represent biologically relevant sensory signals. Here we characterized the spectrotemporal modulation statistics of several natural sound ensembles and examined how neurons encode these statistics in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC) of cats. We report that modulation-tuning in the CNIC is matched to equalize the modulation power of natural sounds. Specifically, natural sounds exhibited a tradeoff between spectral and temporal modulations, which manifests as 1/f modulation power spectrum (MPS). Neural tuning was highly overlapped with the natural sound MPS and neurons approximated proportional resolution filters where modulation bandwidths scaled with characteristic modulation frequencies, a behavior previously described in human psychoacoustics. We demonstrate that this neural scaling opposes the 1/f scaling of natural sounds and enhances the natural sound representation by equalizing their MPS. Modulation tuning in the CNIC may thus have evolved to represent natural sound modulations in a manner consistent with efficiency principles and the resulting characteristics likely underlie perceptual resolution."

    "abstract": "Conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs) can be recognized in 73 species of filamentous fungi covering 21 genera, and develop in culture and in host-pathogen systems. They have been shown to be morphologically and physiologically distinct from germ tubes in Colletotrichum and Neurospora, and under separate genetic control in Neurospora. CATs are short, thin, usually unbranched and arise from conidia or germ tubes. Their formation is conidium-density dependent, and CATs grow towards each other. MAP kinase mutants of Neurospora are blocked in CAT induction. Nuclei pass through fused CATs and are potential agents of gene exchange between individuals of the same and different species. CAT fusion may also serve to improve the chances of colony establishment."

The differences between public and private organizations are examined, and recent trends in human resource management systems (HRMS) are outlined. A case study of the State of Vermont's HRMS is provided, detailing how concerns expressed in 1987 by the director of payroll for Vermont over the existing payroll system led to a major systems project being undertaken, how the project was two years late and more than $1 million over budget, and how, by early 1995, the system was still encountering some problems. This case is used to illustrate many of the pitfalls of public sector management of IT projects. Finally, modifications to private sector management techniques are proposed, and lessons that can be learned from the HRMS experience are identified."

The objective of this study was to determine the population characteristics of feral cats admitted to large-scale TNR programs from geographically diverse locations in the United States. Data from 103,643 feral cats admitted to TNR programs from 1993 to 2004 were evaluated. All groups reported more intact females (53.4%) than intact males (44.3%); only 2.3% of the cats were found to be previously sterilized. Overall, 15.9% of female cats were pregnant at the time of surgery. Pregnancy was highly seasonal and peaked between March and April for all of the groups. The average prenatal litter size was 4.1+/-0.1 fetuses per litter. Cryptorchidism was observed in 1.3% of male cats admitted for sterilization. A total of 0.4% of cats was euthanased because of the presence of debilitating conditions, and 0.4% died during the TNR clinics. Remarkably similar populations of cats with comparable seasonal variability were seen at each program, despite their wide geographical distribution. These results suggest that it is feasible to safely sterilize large numbers of feral cats and that the experiences of existing programs are a consistent source of information upon which to model new TNR programs."

    "abstract": "Social behavior in mammals often relies upon the discrimination of same-species individuals via olfactory processing of unique chemosensory signatures. The ability to identify individuals from a different species by their odor (heterospecific discrimination) is less well documented. Here we used a habituation-dishabituation paradigm to demonstrate that rats can discriminate individual cats by their odor. Rats were repeatedly exposed to a collar previously worn by a domestic cat. Strong initial defensive responses (hiding in a small box and vigilant \"head out\" behavior from the box entrance) habituated with repeated exposure to the same collar. Brain activation following repeated presentation of the same odor - as indexed by c-Fos expression - also habituated in accessory olfactory regions (mitral and granular layers of the posterior accessory olfactory bulb and posteroventral medial amygdala), as well as regions involved in defensive behavior, including the ventromedial and dorsal premammillary hypothalamic nuclei, basolateral amygdala and periaqueductal grey. When a collar taken from a different cat was presented to habituated rats, defensive responses (hiding, vigilance, suppression of grooming) were dishabituated, and c-Fos expression was reinstated in the accessory olfactory system and in defense-related hypothalamic, amygdaloid and brainstem nuclei. Results indicate that rats may process and store details of the chemosensory signatures of individual predators using the accessory olfactory system."

Action potentials were monitored at specified intervals throughout the experiment. The number and size of the signals recorded suggest that this type of electrode provides information that is appropriate for feedback control in functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems. Histology of the nerve revealed that the implants are biocompatible and that little damage is caused by the presence of the electrode."

    "abstract": "Several felid species have been shown to be susceptible to infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype. Infection of felids by H5N1 HPAI virus is often fatal, and cat-to-cat transmission has been documented. Domestic cats may then be involved in the transmission of infection to other animals but also to humans. A particular concern is the hypothetical role of the cat in the adaptation of the virus to mammalian species, thus increasing the pandemic risk. Therefore, the development of a HPAI vaccine for domestic cats should be considered a veterinary and also a public health priority. Here we show that vaccination of cats with a recombinant canarypox (ALVAC®1) virus, expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus A/chicken/Indonesia/03 (H5N1) confers protection against challenge infection with two antigenically distinct H5N1 virus isolates from humans. Despite low hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody titers at the time of challenge, all vaccinated cats were protected against mortality and had reduced histopathological changes in the lungs. Importantly, viral shedding was reduced in vaccinated cats as compared to controls, suggesting that vaccination of cats could reduce the risk of viral transmission. In conclusion this study showed that the recombinant canarypox virus protected cats against homologous and heterologous H5N1 HPAI virus challenges. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrine disease in cats and dogs with increasing prevalence. Type 1 DM appears to be the most common form of diabetes in dogs whereas Type 2 DM prevails for cats. Since insulin resistance is more frequently encountered in cats than dogs, our laboratory was interested in determining whether differences at the insulin signaling pathway level and differences in glucose and lipid metabolism could be observed between cats and dogs. Insulin resistance has been positively correlated to insulin signaling pathway abnormalities. As such, this study measured insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) P-85alpha mRNA expression levels in classical insulin-responsive sensitive tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, and abdominal fat) and peripheral leukocytes between cats and dogs by qRT-PCR. Different tissues were sampled because it is currently unknown where insulin-resistance arises from. In addition, enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were also assessed since glucose and lipid metabolism differs between cats and dogs. Overall, IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3-K, MDH, G6DPH, and FAS mRNA tissue expression profiles demonstrated different levels of expression, in various tissues for both canines and felines, which was expected. No distinct expression pattern emerged; however, differences were noted between canines and felines. In addition, IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3-K, MDH, G6DPH, and FAS mRNA expression was significantly higher in canine versus feline tissues, including peripheral leukocytes. Remarkable differences in insulin signaling gene expression between felines and canines indicate that cats may have an underlying low insulin sensitivity level due to low IRS-1, IRS-2, and PI3-K P-85alpha mRNA expression levels which would predispose cats to develop insulin resistance. Moreover, differences in glucose and lipid metabolism related gene expression (MDH, G6DPH, and FAS) demonstrate that felines have an overall lower metabolic rate in various tissues which may be attributed to overall lower insulin signaling gene expression and a lack of physical activity as compared to canines. Therefore, a combination of genetic and environmental factors appears to make felines more prone to suffer from insulin resistance and type 2 DM than canines."

However, the anatomical knowledge of this system in cats is not sufficient to develop a reasoned model for the extirpation of these glands in the case of malignant tumours. A study of the topography of the collector vessels in 50 female cats was conducted by indirect injection in vivo of India ink inside the mammary parenchyma. All the lymph nodes were controlled by microscopic examination and lymph vessels were examined after clearing. The success rate of the colouration of the lymph vessels was 76.4%. Clearing showed several principal routes of drainage, different for each gland. Contrary to the presentation observed in the bitch, no evidence existed in any of the 65 cases of lymphatic plexuses connecting the two mammary glands of each row in the female cat. The result of this study is in favour of the development of a new model for the surgical extirpation of mammary tumours in cats."

Noise, destructive behaviors, excrement, bites, and the overpopulation of domestic cats and dogs are some of the major problems that can result in stress and hardships on owners, neighbors, the community, and the pets themselves. The perpetuation of pets in society requires that the negative aspects of living with dogs and cats be addressed. Veterinarians can play an important role in addressing these problems by incorporating the concept of behavior wellness into their practices and promoting education regarding husbandry, animal behavior, responsible pet ownership, and the effects of pets on the environment."

For that purpose, fleas from different colonies from North America, Germany and South Africa were used to induce infestations in cats under laboratory conditions. In each study, between 12 and 16 cats were allocated randomly to 2 groups. Cats in Group 1 were not treated and served as controls. Cats in Group 2 were treated once on Day 0 with BROADLINE® at the minimum recommended dosage of 0.12mg/kg body weight. In 4 studies, all animals were infested experimentally with unfed C. felis (100±5) on Days 2 (or 1), 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Live fleas were counted 24h post-treatment or infestation. In 2 additional studies, animals were infested at the same frequency with gravid C. felis fleas (100±5) that were fed previously on an untreated host. Forty-eight hours post-infestation, flea eggs were collected, counted and incubated for the evaluation of the reduction of emergence of adults. The combined curative efficacy against adult fleas at 24h after treatment was 94.3% and the combined preventive efficacy values remained greater than 95.9% at 24h after 5 subsequent weekly infestations. In addition, the product reduced dramatically the emergence of new adult fleas for at least 5 weeks (>98.1% for one month and 93.2% at 5 weeks after infestation), demonstrating its efficiency in preventing environmental contamination by immature stages. © 2014 The Authors."

The perforations were closed by hyperplastic squamous epithelium exhibiting a marked keratin production. This keratin formed a membranous structure which primarily appeared to close the perforation. No ingrowth of squamous epithelium into the middle ear cavity could be detected. Generally speaking, the perforations had closed within 9-11 days in rats and within 12-14 days in cats."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this randomized, multicenter study was to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (LED) and doxorubicin (DOX) in the treatment of feline vaccine-associated sarcoma (VAS). Cats were divided according to their disease status into a microscopic arm (no evidence of gross disease) and a macroscopic arm (evidence of gross disease). Each arm was randomized to receive either LED (1-1.5 mg/kg i.v. q3 weeks) or DOX (1 mg/kg i.v. q3 weeks). Thirty-three cats were entered in the macroscopic arm of the study with an overall response rate of 39% (5 complete response and 8 partial response) and a median time to progression of 84 days. Response rates were not different between LED and DOX. Seventy-five cats were entered into the microscopic arm. When compared to a similar historical control population treated with surgery alone, the cats receiving chemotherapy had a prolonged median disease-free interval (388 days versus 93 days). No difference in efficacy was detected between LED and DOX. LED at 1.5 mg/kg induced delayed nephrotoxicosis in 23%, necessitating a decrease in the recommended dosage to 1 mg/kg, and cutaneous toxicosis in 21.7% of treated cats. This study showed that both DOX and LED are efficacious in the treatment of VAS and should be considered in the treatment of this tumor."

    "abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of the human olfactory system, beginning with the peripheral receptor neurons in the nasal cavity and the first relay in the olfactory bulb. The projections of the olfactory bulb to the primary olfactory cortical areas are described in macaque monkeys, and the comparable olfactory areas in the human brain are described. It is noted that humans are generally considered \"microsmatic,\" with a relatively poorly developed olfactory system compared to that of \"macrosmatic\" mammals. Indeed, the structure and lamination of the olfactory bulb and primary olfactory cortex are not as well-defined in humans as in rodents and carnivores. Further, the olfactory structures certainly do not make up as large a fraction of the forebrain in humans as in rats and cats. However, almost all the major olfactory structures found in rats are also present in humans, and in absolute terms the human structures are far from rudimentary. Finally, olfactory projections to the hypothalamus, thalamus, and frontal cortex are discussed, based on experimental work in monkeys and on functional imaging studies in humans. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Portosystemic shunt (PSS) is the most common cause of hepatic encephalopathy in dogs and cats. Fasting ammonia and serum bile acids (SBA) are used to diagnose PSS, but their true sensitivity and specificity have not been fully evaluated, especially in cats. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of fasting ammonia and SBA concentrations in the diagnosis of PSS in dogs and cats and to compare diagnostic accuracy between species. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from 373 dogs and 85 cats presented to the clinic from 1996 to 2006 was carried out. Based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, animals were grouped as having PSS, parenchymal hepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease. The sensitivity and specificity of ammonia and SBA concentrations for the diagnosis of PSS were calculated and receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to optimize cut-offs. RESULTS: Using the upper limit of laboratory reference intervals (ammonia, 59 micromol/L; SBA, 20 micromol/L), the sensitivity and specificity of ammonia was 85% and 86% in dogs, and 83% and 76% in cats, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of SBA was 93% and 67% in dogs, and 100% and 71% in cats, respectively. Using optimal cut-off points for ammonia (dogs, 57 micromol/L; cats, 94 micromol/L) the sensitivity and specificity was 91% and 84% in dogs and 83% and 86% in cats, respectively. Using optimal cut-off points for SBA (dogs, 58 micromol/L; cats, 34 micromol/L) the sensitivity and specificity was 78% and 87% in dogs and 100% and 84% in cats. CONCLUSION: Increased fasting ammonia and SBA concentrations are accurate indicators of PSS. An improvement in diagnostic accuracy can be achieved by using defined optimal cut-off points for the selective diagnosis of PSS."

    "abstract": "Quantitative understanding of the transmission dynamics of lymphatic filarial parasites is essential for the rational planning of control strategies. One of the most important determinants of transmission dynamics is the relationship between parasite yield, the success rate of ingested microfilariae (mf) becoming infective larvae in a mosquito vector, and mf density in the source of the human blood meal. Three types of relationship have been recognized in human filaria/mosquito couples--limitation, facilitation and proportionality; facilitation has hitherto been observed only in the couple Wuchereria bancrofti/Anopheles gambiae in Burkina Faso, in experimental studies on a high density mf carrier. The present paper demonstrates facilitation in W. bancrofti/An. gambiae and W. bancrofti/An. arabiensis in lower mf density carriers in The Gambia and Tanzania, and in W. bancrofti/An. funestus in Tanzania. Facilitation was not found in An. melas in The Gambia nor in An. merus in Tanzania. Analysis of published data shows limitation at low level mf densities in W. bancrofti/Culex quinquefasciatus in Sri Lanka, and in the same couple in India. Limitation also occurs in Brugia malayi/Aedes togoi in experimental cats; proportionality occurs in B. malayi/Mansonia bonneae in Malaysia. The epidemiological significance of these host/parasite relationships is discussed, and supporting evidence for its validity is presented from the published results of large-scale control programmes."

    "abstract": "1. The early visual experience of nine cats was restricted to viewing horizontal or vertical lines inside opaque goggles. 2. When the kittens were 3-4 mo old, extracellular recordings were made in the primary visual cortex. To obtain a representative sample of cortical cells, units were studied at regularly spaced intervals along the course of electrode penetrations traveling oblique to the cortical surface. An automated assessment of preferred orientation using a computer-driven optical display was employed, and during the recording session the experimenters did not know which orientation(s) each animal had viewed in early life. 3. In the cats that viewed horizontal lines with one eye and vertical lines with the other during rearing, two major findings of previous workers (14) were confirmed. First, a majority of units were not selective for orientation. Second, units with preferred orientations near vertical tended to be activated exclusively by the eye that had viewed vertical, and likewise for horizontal. 4. In cats that viewed lines of the same orientation with both eyes during rearing, a substantially smaller proportion of units were selective for orientation; the preferred orientations of these units also tended to match the orientation to which the cats had been exposed. 5. Portions of some electrode penetrations showed an orderly arrangement of cells according to preferred orientation similar to that seen in normal cats, but with regions over which only nonselective cells were found. Many penetrations appeared less orderly. 6. The results are consistent with a role for early visual experience in maintaining the responsiveness and innate selectivity of cortical neurons, although they cannot entirely rule out the possibility that experience may alter or determine the preferred orientation of some cells."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous cortical activity--ongoing activity in the absence of intentional sensory input--has been studied extensively, using methods ranging from EEG (electroencephalography), through voltage sensitive dye imaging, down to recordings from single neurons. Ongoing cortical activity has been shown to play a critical role in development, and must also be essential for processing sensory perception, because it modulates stimulus-evoked activity, and is correlated with behaviour. Yet its role in the processing of external information and its relationship to internal representations of sensory attributes remains unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we previously established a close link between ongoing activity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized cats and the spontaneous firing of a single neuron. Here we report that such activity encompasses a set of dynamically switching cortical states, many of which correspond closely to orientation maps. When such an orientation state emerged spontaneously, it spanned several hypercolumns and was often followed by a state corresponding to a proximal orientation. We suggest that dynamically switching cortical states could represent the brain's internal context, and therefore reflect or influence memory, perception and behaviour."

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi populations and parasite transmission dynamics have been well documented throughout the Americas, but few studies have been conducted in the Gran Chaco ecoregion, one of the most highly endemic areas for Chagas disease, caused by T. cruzi. In this study, we assessed the distribution of T. cruzi lineages (identified by PCR strategies) in Triatoma infestans, domestic dogs, cats, humans and sylvatic mammals from two neighbouring rural areas with different histories of transmission and vector control in northern Argentina. Lineage II predominated amongst the 99 isolates characterised and lineage I amongst the six isolates obtained from sylvatic mammals. T. cruzi lineage IIe predominated in domestic habitats; it was found in 87% of 54 isolates from Tr. infestans, in 82% of 33 isolates from dogs, and in the four cats found infected. Domestic and sylvatic cycles overlapped in the study area in the late 1980s, when intense domestic transmission occurred, and still overlap marginally. The introduction of T. cruzi from sylvatic into domestic habitats is likely to occur very rarely in the current epidemiological context. The household distribution of T. cruzi lineages showed that Tr. infestans, dogs and cats from a given house compound shared the same parasite lineage in most cases. Based on molec- ular evidence, this result lends further support to the importance of dogs and cats as domestic reservoir hosts of T. cruzi. We believe that in Argentina, this is the first time that lineage IIc has been isolated from naturally infected domestic dogs and Tr. infestans.  2008 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

    "abstract": "With domestication and urbanisation, cats have transformed from being hunting animals that eat protein-rich prey into more sedentary animals that eat a carbohydrate-rich diet. It was hypothesised that a high intake of dry cat food and a lack of physical activity may play a role in the development of feline type 2 diabetes mellitus. Information on dietary history and physical activity of 96 cats with diabetes mellitus and 192 matched controls was collected retrospectively, using a telephone questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between questionnaire-derived variables and the development of diabetes mellitus. The energy percentage of dry food in the diet was not significantly correlated with the development of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.29), whereas both indoor confinement (P = 0.002) and low physical activity (P = 0.004) were. The results indicated that the proportion of dry food in a cat's diet may not be an independent risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas physical inactivity and indoor confinement are. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

All cats were domestic short (19) or long hair (2) with a mean age of 9.3 years at diagnosis. Increased peripheral blood LGL counts were present in 18/21 cats. Neutrophilia (12/21 cats) and increased serum liver enzymes (7/12), total and direct bilirubin (7/13), BUN (5/14), and creatinine (2/14) were observed. Cats usually presented with advanced disease and none survived longer than 84 days (mean 18.8 days) postdiagnosis. Cytologically, LGLs had a mature (6/21), immature (13/21), or mixed (2/21) morphology. Necropsy lesions consisted of neoplastic lymphoid infiltrates in the jejunum, ileum, and duodenum in decreasing order of frequency. In the small intestine, mucosal ulceration (9/13) and epitheliotropism of neoplastic cells (9/13) were common. Neoplastic infiltrates were also present in the mesenteric lymph nodes (13/13), liver (12/13), spleen (8/13), kidneys (5/7), and bone marrow (5/7). A T cell phenotype (CD3epsilon+) characterized LGL neoplasia in 19/21 cases. A CD8alphaalpha+ cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype was present in 12/19 T cell tumors, 2 had a CD4+CD8alphaalpha phenotype, 3 had a CD4-CD8- phenotype, and 2 were CD4+ helper T cells. CD8beta chain expression was not detected in any instance. In two cats, a B or T cell origin could not be established. CD103 was expressed by 11 of 19 (58%) of the lymphomas tested. The immunophenotypic features shared by neoplastic LGLs in the cat and feline intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) support a small intestinal IEL origin for feline LGL lymphoma."

    "abstract": "There is good evidence from archaeological contexts and from a large body of contemporary sculpture to allow a reasonable estimate of the clothing of some Picts, the descendents of the Celtic tribes, in Scotland. Faunal and plant remains on Pictish domestic sites provide information about the raw materials available for clothing. Wool, hides, and leather were available for clothing, as were fur pelts from foxes, martens, cats, dogs, seals, and brown bears. The archaeological record of late Pictish times in Orkney and Shetland suggest that flax fibers, which could be processed and woven into linen, were in general use. Graves are often a rich source of information about clothing and personal belongings, but there was no tradition of formal burial grave goods among the Picts. Full-length tunics and cloaks appear to have been worn by monks, clerics, and women, calf-length tunics or trousers and short cloaks or plaids by foot-soldiers, and short tunics, trousers, and short capes or plaids by horse-borne warriors. Short tunics were also worn by mythological or pagan religious figures. Most male clothing is likely to have been made of wool, linen, or leather."

The objective of this study was to report the presenting complaints, clinical examination findings, diagnostic findings, treatment outcomes and survival times in cats diagnosed with a PDA in the UK. Medical records from three major UK referral centres were searched for cats that were diagnosed with PDA from January 2004 to December 2012. Data obtained for analysis included: Signalment, clinical examination findings including murmur characteristics, diagnostic imaging findings, treatment outcomes and survival times. Nineteen cats were included in the analysis. The most common reason for referral was investigation of an incidentally detected heart murmur without clinical signs (13/19; 68 per cent). Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was diagnosed in seven (37 per cent) cats and those cats with PAH were significantly more likely to present with signs of disease (P=0.004). Median survival time in cats that were diagnosed with PDA and died due to cardiac causes was 898 days (interquartile range 459-1011 days). The median survival time of those cats that had an additional congenital anomaly was significantly shorter to those cats without a congenital anomaly (P=0.008)."

    "abstract": "Some previous reports indicate that the excitability of the brain may be increased for days following enflurane anesthesia. The authors investigated this possibility in cats by determining whether or not pentylenetetrazol- (Metrazol??) or lidocaine-seizure thresholds decreased after repeated enflurane exposure. The lidocaine-seizure threshold was bracketed in 4 cats, and the pentylenetetrazol-seizure threshold was bracketed in another 4 cats. Each cat was then exposed to 4% enflurane for 2 hours on 4 successive days. Twenty-four hours after the last enflurane exposure, the cats were injected with the previously determined subthreshold dose of pentylenetetrazol (6.4 mg/kg, on the average) or lidocaine (7.8 mg/kg, on the average). No cat convulsed. It was therefore concluded that under our experimental conditions, repeated enflurane exposure does not increase the sensitivity to drugs which nonselectively excite the central nervous system (e.g., pentylenetetrazol) or to drugs which mimic temporal lobe epilepsy (e.g., lidocaine). This finding casts doubt that brain excitability is increased in the post-enflurane anesthetic period."

    "abstract": "Ocular dominance in extrastriate visual cortex of cats with behaviorally defined strabismic amblyopia was studied using extracellular recording techniques. In area 18, the amblyopic eye drove about as many cells as the normal one. In area posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area (PMLS), about 60% of the cells responded exclusively to stimulation of the normal eye and 30% to stimulation of the amblyopic eye. In area 21a more than 75% of the cells were monocularly driven by the non-amblyopic eye while only 5% were monocularly driven by the amblyopic eye. These findings suggest that ventral pathways (area 21a) are more affected in amblyopia than dorsal pathways (area PMLS)."

    "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin are commonly described in cats. Reported treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and photodynamic therapy. This preliminary study reports on the management of these lesions combining the local administration of bleomycin (plus hyaluronidase for a more uniform distribution) with permeabilizing biphasic electric pulses. Nine cats with SCC graded T(2)-T(4) were treated over a 5 year period, and each cat received two sessions of electrochemotherapy (ECT) 1 week apart. The side effects of this treatment were minimal and limited to mild erythema of the nose. Seven of the cats (77.7%) had a complete response lasting up to 3 years. ECT seems to be a safe and effective option for the treatment of feline sun-induced squamous cell carcinomas and warrants further investigation."

The mean age was 10.8 years and all were neutered males. Nasal aspergillosis was diagnosed in five cats, cryptococcosis in three cats, hyalohyphomycosis in one cat, and trichosporonosis in one cat. Bilateral disease was present in eight cats, seven had abnormal soft tissue attenuation in two-thirds of the nasal cavity, and six had turbinate lysis. Seven cats had also lysis of the hard palate, nasal septum, or frontal bone. One cat had lysis of the cribriform plate. Five of the nine cats whose lymph nodes were imaged had lymph node enlargement. There was contrast medium enhancement in the nasal cavity in all cats, with either a primarily peripheral rim or heterogeneous pattern. There appears to be an overlap of clinical signs, age, and CT features of cats with nasal neoplasia and those with fungal rhinitis/ sinusitis."

    "abstract": "Objective—To evaluate the effect of a long-term trap- neuter-return program, with adoption whenever pos- sible, on the dynamics of a free-roaming cat popula- tion. Design—Observational epidemiologic study. Animals—155 unowned free-roaming cats. Procedures—Free-roaming cats residing on a univer- sity campus were trapped, neutered, and returned to the environment or adopted over an 11-year period. Results—During the observation period (January 1991 to April 2002), 75% of the cats were feral, and 25% were socialized. Kittens comprised 56% of the original population. Male cats were slightly more numerous (55%) than females. At the conclusion of the observation period, 47% of the cats had been removed for adoption, 15% remained on site, 15% had disappeared, 11% were euthanatized, 6% had died, and 6% had moved to the surrounding wooded environment. Trapping began in 1991; however, a complete census of cats was not completed until 1996, at which time 68 cats resided on site. At com- pletion of the study in 2002, the population had decreased by 66%, from 68 to 23 cats (of which 22 were feral). No kittens were observed on site after 1995, but additional stray or abandoned cats contin- ued to become resident. New arrivals were neutered or adopted before they could reproduce. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—A compre- hensive long-term program of neutering followed by adoption or return to the resident colony can result in reduction of free-roaming cat populations in urban areas."

    "abstract": "Cauxin is an abundant protein in feline urine. We have used proteomics strategies to characterize cauxin from the urine of domestic cats and a number of big cat species. Proteins were resolved by gel-based electrophoretic purification and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The resultant tryptic peptides were mass-measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Peptides were also resolved by liquid chromatography and analyzed by electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry to generate fragment ion data to infer the amino acid sequence. We identified cauxin polymorphisms and corrected a sequencing artifact in cauxin from the domestic cat. The proteomics data also provided positive evidence for the presence of a cauxin homolog in the urine of big cats (Pantherinae), including the Sumatran tiger, Asiatic lion, clouded leopard, Persian leopard, and jaguar. The levels of cauxin in the urine of all big cats were substantially lower than that in the urine of intact male domestic cats."

    "abstract": "Leishmania is primarily characterized by existing in two stages in its life cycle, each occurs in a distinct host. The amastigote stage found in the cytoplasm of the reticulo- endothelial cells, monocytes and other phagocytic cells of the vertebrate host. The promastigote stage found in the gut of its insect vector. The leishmaniasis comprise several diseases of wide diversity of manifestations caused by different species of the genus Leishmania. Because of the virtual morphological identity of the organisms throughout the genus, they are classified according to the clinical conditions which they produce in man, under three main headings: (1) Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL.), (2) Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL.), (3) Visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Generally speaking, leishmaniasis is an example of a zoonosis that reaches man through an insect vector. The great majority of the Leishmania species are maintained by mammalian reservoir hosts in natural foci of infection. Rodents, dogs, wild cats, jackals, foxes, sloths, hyraxes and other carnivores are the animal reservoirs which maintain the infection in nature. The insect vectors are over 50 species of the genus Phlebotomus in the Old World and genus Lutzomyia in the New World."

    "abstract": "The feasibility of implanting an array of penetrating electrodes into peripheral nerves is studied in acute experiments in the cat sciatic nerve. A novel, silicon-based array of microelectrodes, the Utah Electrode Array, was used, which contains 25 or 100 1-mm long electrodes that project out from a silicon substrate. Electrode arrays of this complexity, when inserted in the peripheral nerve, could cause significant compression of the nerve and block the conduction of action potentials. Using a high velocity insertion technique, the electrode array was implanted into the sciatic nerve. Compound action potentials were evoked by and recorded with cuff electrodes. Compound action potentials recorded 1 h after insertion were only slightly altered from those recorded before insertion. Single units were readily extracted from evoked multiunit neural recordings in response to cutaneous stimulation and limb rotation around joints. Current injections into the nerve through the electrodes evoked muscle twitches with currents in the 10 microA range. Recording and stimulation stability were demonstrated for periods of up to 60 h. We have shown that high density arrays of electrodes can be inserted into the peripheral nerve and can provide a stable recording and stimulating interface to individual peripheral nerve axons. Such an array may be useful in future neuroscience research and potential neuroprosthetic applications."

    "abstract": "The congenitally deaf cat suffers from a degeneration of the inner ear. The organ of Corti bears no hair cells, yet the auditory afferents are preserved. Since these animals have no auditory experience, they were used as a model for congenital deafness. Kittens were equipped with a cochlear implant at different ages and electro-stimulated over a period of 2.0-5.5 months using a monopolar single-channel compressed analogue stimulation strategy (VIENNA-type signal processor). Following a period of auditory experience, we investigated cortical field potentials in response to electrical biphasic pulses applied by means of the cochlear implant. In comparison to naive unstimulated deaf cats and normal hearing cats, the chronically stimulated animals showed larger cortical regions producing middle-latency responses at or above 300 microV amplitude at the contralateral as well as the ipsilateral auditory cortex. The cortex ipsilateral to the chronically stimulated ear did not show any signs of reduced responsiveness when stimulating the 'untrained' ear through a second cochlear implant inserted in the final experiment. With comparable duration of auditory training, the activated cortical area was substantially smaller if implantation had been performed at an older age of 5-6 months. The data emphasize that young sensory systems in cats have a higher capacity for plasticity than older ones and that there is a sensitive period for the cat's auditory system."

    "abstract": "The drivers of the age-related decline in maintenance energy requirement in humans are primarily reduced physical activity and a decrease in basal metabolic rate, which is largely driven by changes in body composition. Most studies indicate that there is a significant loss of lean body mass and a concomitant increase in fat mass with advancing age. The causal factors appear to be changes in physical activity and a reduction in the activity of growth hormone. Sustained physical activity and/or administration of growth hormone have been shown to offset age-related changes in lean:fat ratios in humans and in rats. Very little information is available on dogs, but current data suggest that aging is accompanied by a decrease in lean:fat ratios. The rate and extent of change is similar to that observed in aging humans and it is assumed that the same causal factors are responsible. On this basis, it is likely that basal metabolic rate declines in older dogs. New evidence suggests that the situation is very different in cats, with no apparent change in lean:fat ratios with advancing age. This is probably related to constant activity levels throughout life and suggests that basal metabolic rate probably does not decrease as cats age. On the basis of this evidence, there is no reason to reduce energy provision to the majority of older cats."

The cats developed a progressive syndrome of lethargy, ataxia, blindness, stupor, and seizures following an abrupt increase in blood pressure associated with a surgical reduction in renal mass. The cats had severe gross brain edema, evidenced by cerebellar changes of caudal coning and cranial displacement over the corpora quadrigemina and cerebral changes of widening and flattening of the gyri. Histologically, interstitial edema was most pronounced in the cerebral white matter. Hypertensive vascular lesions were present as hyaline arteriolosclerosis in one cat and hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis in the other. Rare foci of parenchymal microhemorrhages and necrosis were also observed. Systemic hypertension (especially severe or rapidly developing) accompanied by neurologic signs and the pathologic findings of diffuse brain edema with cerebral arteriolosclerosis are consistent with an etiologic diagnosis of hypertensive encephalopathy."

    "abstract": "Objective: To describe the functional outcome of canine and feline survivors of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and the clinical characteristics surrounding their resuscitation. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Veterinary teaching hospital. Animals: Client-owned dogs (15) and cats (3) with CPA. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Eighteen animals were identiﬁed to have survived to discharge following CPA. Cardiopulmonary arrest was associated with anesthesia with or without preexisting disease in 10 animals, cardiovascular collapse in 5 animals, and chronic disease with an imposed stress in 3 animals. All CPAs were witnessed in the hospital. The most common initial rhythm at CPA was asystole (72%). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in less than 15 minutes from the onset of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) in all animals. No animals had a recurrence of CPA after the initial CPA. Animals were of a wide range of ages (0.5–16 years) and breeds. Two animals were neurologically abnormal at discharge, one of which was normal at 2 months following CPA. Conclusions: A good functional recovery after CPCR was documented in the small number of CPA survivors presented in this study. This may be due to the reversible nature of their inciting cause of CPA, early detections of CPA (‘witnessed’), and/or the animal’s underlying normal health status."

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common condition in cats characterised by infiltration of inflammatory cells into the intestinal mucosa. In this study, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in intestinal biopsies from cats. Biopsies were collected from seven cats with chronic diarrhoea and histologically confirmed IBD, five cats with chronic diarrhoea due to non-IBD gastrointestinal (GI) disease, and nine clinically normal cats with or without subclinical inflammatory changes in small intestine. Real-time RT-PCR was developed for quantification of mRNA encoding interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (p35 and p40), IL-18, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-[alpha]), interferon-gamma (IFN-[gamma]) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-[beta]). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a `housekeeper' gene. All real-time PCR efficiencies were > 90% (range 90.4-102%) with correlation coefficients >0.99 (range 0.998-1). The results of the study were analyzed on the basis of either clinical presentation or histopathological evidence of intestinal inflammation. The former analysis showed that mRNA encoding IL-10 and TGF-[beta] (immunoregulatory cytokines), and IL-6, IL-18, TNF-[alpha] and IL-12 p40 (Th1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines) was significantly higher in clinically normal cats and cats with IBD when compared to cats with other GI diseases. IL-5 mRNA was significantly higher in cats with IBD compared to clinically normal cats. IL-2 mRNA was significantly lower in cats with non-IBD GI disease than in clinically normal cats. Analysis on the basis of histopathological change revealed that cats with intestinal inflammation had significantly more transcription of genes encoding IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-[alpha] and TGF-[beta] than those with normal intestinal morphology. The results suggest that immune dysregulation plays a role in feline IBD and that IBD in cats has a complicated pathogenesis with both pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features."

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of chronic rhinitis in cats is poorly understood and consistently effective therapies are not currently available. Therefore, randomized clinical trials were conducted to evaluate a novel immunotherapy for treatment of chronic rhinitis in adult (n = 12) and young cats (n = 28). In addition, cytokine profiles in cats with chronic rhinitis were compared to those of healthy cats. Cats were treated with a potent stimulator of innate immunity (liposome-IL-2 DNA complexes) and the effects of treatment on clinical signs and immune function were assessed. In adult cats with chronic rhinitis, immunotherapy led to significant improvement in frequency of sneezing but not in other clinical signs when compared to the placebo group, whereas immunotherapy failed to improve clinical signs in younger cats. Analysis of cytokine expression in cats with rhinitis did not reveal evidence of a Th2 cytokine bias in cats with rhinitis. We conclude that chronic rhinitis in cats is not a Th2-biased disease and that immunotherapy may lead to clinical improvement in adult cats with the disease."

    "abstract": "Animals have developed a range of drinking strategies depending on physiological and environmental constraints. Vertebrates with incomplete cheeks use their tongue to drink; the most common example is the lapping of cats and dogs. We show that the domestic cat (Felis catus) laps by a subtle mechanism based on water adhesion to the dorsal side of the tongue. A combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that Felis catus exploits fluid inertia to defeat gravity and pull liquid into the mouth. This competition between inertia and gravity sets the lapping frequency and yields a prediction for the dependence of frequency on animal mass. Measurements of lapping frequency across the family Felidae support this prediction, which suggests that the lapping mechanism is conserved among felines."

    "abstract": "Rapid sampling microdialysis (rsMD) directed towards the cerebral cortex has allowed identification of a combined time-series signature for glucose and lactate that characterizes peri-infarct depolarization in experimental focal ischaemia, but no comparable data exist for 'classical' cortical spreading depression (CSD) associated with hyperaemia in the normally perfused brain. Here, we examined the rsMD responses of dialysate glucose and lactate to five hyperaemic spreading depressions induced with intracortical microinjections, typically of 1 mol/L KCl, in open-skull preparations in five cats under chloralose anaesthesia. Depolarization was verified with microelectrodes, and laser speckle flowmetry was used to examine propagation of the events and perfusion responses near the MD probe. Ten minutes after depolarization, dialysate glucose fell and lactate rose by 28% and 58% respectively. There was no recovery of dialysate glucose 30 mins after depolarization. Mean baseline indicative cerebral blood flow was 25.5+/-4.1 mL/100 g/min and mean maximum hyperaemic increase was by 29.6+/-6 mL/100 g/min; hyperaemia remained present 30 mins after CSD. As CSD events are repetitive, frequent, and often clustered temporally in human acute brain injury, these results indicate a high risk of depletion of extracellular glucose in association with depolarization events of a pattern previously thought to be largely benign."

    "abstract": "Island ecosystems are, in general, more vulnerable to change than are those on continents, and the West Indies are no exception. In the past 155 years a minimum of 7-12 extinctions and 12-13 extirpations of amphibians and reptiles have occurred in the West Indies. In the Lesser Antilles (and other small islands), most extirpations can be attributed to the introduction of alien predators (primarily the mongoose, but also cats and dogs). Certain species appear more sensitive to predator introductions than others (e.g., teiid lizards of the genus Ameiva and colubrid snakes of the genera Alsophis and Liophis). On mongoose-infested islands, other factors were investigated (human population density, island area, physiographic complexity), but none absolved the mongoose as the primary agent of extirpation. In the Greater Antilles, although introduced predators have had a negative impact, extinctions due to habitat destruction appear more likely due to the potentially stenoecious adaptation of many taxa (e.g., tree crown-, buttress-, and bromeliad-dwelling species)."

We investigated attitudes of Texas A{\\&}M University (TAMU) employees toward domestic cats living on university property and methods available for population control. We randomly selected 1,000 TAMU faculty and staff of the College Station campus from among 9,562 names in the university directory and mailed them a self-administered questionnaire. Questions addressed personal characteristics; attitudes about nuisance behaviors associated with cats, euthanasia, and cat overpopulation; preferred control method for cat populations in 6 locations; and expected outcomes of each control method. Preference of control method for cats on campus was influenced by respondents' sex, perception of nuisance, and expected outcome of each control method. While respondents in this study recognized the predatory impact of cats on wildlife species in natural areas and on campus, they did not believe the cat's exotic status or its predation on wildlife was a legitimate reason for controlling population numbers."

    "abstract": "Immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was analyzed in unoperated cats and in cats in which stereotaxic lesions were made in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei. The fine reaction product revealed moderate to dense ChAT-immunoreactive fiber plexuses throughout the telencephalon, diencephalon, and midbrain. A pontomesencephalic origin of cholinergic innervation to virtually every nucleus of the diencephalon, as well as to various midbrain and basal telencephalic sites was indicated in the cats with lesions, in which the optical density of ChAT-immunoreactivity was significantly decreased as compared to controls. Pontomesencephalic lesions produced no changes, however, in the density of ChAT staining in the cerebral cortex, basolateral amygdala, or caudate nucleus. In addition to ChAT-positive terminal fiber arborizations which were widely distributed, cholinergic fibers-of-passage were traced in the unoperated and operated feline brains. The general course of ChAT fibers cut in cross-section was followed in successive transverse levels, and although pathways originating from the pedunculopontine nucleus demonstrated orientations in every direction, many demonstrated a rostral course. A particularly dense aggregate of ascending ChAT-positive fibers was localized in the dorsolateral sector of the pedunculopontine area which could be followed at more rostral levels into the central tegmental fields and the compact part of the substantia nigra. From the central tegmental fields, numerous ChAT-immunopositive fibers cut in cross-section continued to course rostrally in the intralaminar, reticular and lateroposterior nuclei of the thalamus, and a distinct bundle of ChAT fibers coursing dorsolaterally was observed medial to the optic tract ascending to the lateral geniculate. ChAT fibers with dorsolateral orientations were additionally observed in the zona incerta, ventral anterior thalamus, and ansa lenticularis on route to the reticular thalamus, the globus pallidus, and the substantia innominata. Pathways consisting of fibers traced from ChAT-containing cells in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus could be traced to medial structures such as the periaqueductal gray, ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe. Medially placed ChAT fibers were additionally followed through the ventral tegmental area, the midline thalamus, and the hypothalamus, up to the medial and lateral septal nuclei. The trajectories of the ascending cholinergic pathways from the pontomesencephalon are discussed in relation to locally generated electrophysiological responses in the cat"

    "abstract": "An epidemic of sporotrichosis, a subcutaneous mycosis caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii, is ongoing in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in which cases of human infection are related to exposure to cats. In an attempt to demonstrate the zoonotic character of this epidemic using molecular methodology, we characterised by DNA-based typing methods 19 human and 25 animal S. schenckii isolates from the epidemic, as well as two control strains. To analyse the isolates, the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was performed using three different primers, together with DNA fingerprinting using the minisatellite derived from the wild-type phage M13 core-sequence. The analyses generated amplicons with considerable polymorphism. Although isolates exhibited high levels of genetic relatedness, they could be clustered into 5-10 genotypes. The RAPD profiles of epidemic S. schenckii isolates could be distinguished from that of the United States isolate, displaying 20% similarity to each primer and 60% when amplified with the M13 primer. DNA fingerprinting of S. schenckii isolated from the nails (42.8%) and the oral cavities (66%) of cats were identical to related human samples, suggesting that there is a common infection source for animals and humans in this epidemic. It is clear that cats act as a vehicle for dissemination of S. schenckii."

This experiment evaluated scFOS and GOS supplementation on nutrient digestibility, fermentative end product production, and fecal microbial ecology of cats. Eight healthy adult cats were fed diets containing no prebiotic, 0.5% scFOS, 0.5% GOS, or 0.5% scFOS + 0.5% GOS (scFOS + GOS) in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Apparent total tract CP digestibility was decreased (P < 0.05) when cats were fed a diet containing scFOS + GOS compared with the other treatments. Dry matter, OM, acid hydrolyzed fat, and GE digestibilities were not different (P > 0.05) among treatments. Cats fed scFOS-, GOS-, and scFOS + GOS-supplemented diets had greater (P < 0.05) fecal Bifidobacterium spp. populations compared with cats fed the control diet. Fecal pH was less (P < 0.05) for cats fed the scFOS + GOS-supplemented diet compared with the control. Butyrate (P = 0.05) and valerate (P < 0.05) concentrations were greater when cats consumed the scFOS + GOS diet. Acetate tended (P = 0.10) to be greater when cats were fed the scFOS + GOS diet. Total short-chain fatty acid (P = 0.06) and total branched-chain fatty acid (P = 0.06) concentrations also tended to be greater when cats consumed the scFOS + GOS treatment. Fecal protein catabolites, including ammonia, 4-methylphenol, indole, and biogenic amines, blood lymphocytes, neutrophils, total white blood cell counts, or fecal DM concentration and output did not differ (P > 0.05) among treatments. Low level supplementation of scFOS, GOS, and their combination exert positive effects on select indices of gut health in cats."

    "abstract": "Bartonella henselae is an emerging bacterial pathogen, causing cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis. Cats bacteremic with B. henselae constitute a large reservoir from which humans become infected. Prevention of human infection depends on elucidation of the natural history and means of feline infection. We studied 47 cattery cats in a private home for 12 months to determine the longitudinal prevalence of B. henselae bacteremia, the prevalence of B. henselae in the fleas infesting these cats, and whether B. henselae is transmitted experimentally to cats via fleas. Vector-mediated transmission of B.henselae isolates was evaluated by removing fleas from the naturally bacteremic, flea-infested cattery cats and transferring these fleas to specific-pathogen-free (SPF) kittens housed in a controlled, arthropod-free University Animal Facility. B. henselae bacteremia was detected in 89% of the 47 naturally infected cattery cats. A total of 132 fleas were removed from cats whose blood was simultaneously cultured during different seasons and were tested individually for the presence of B. henselae DNA by PCR. B. henselae DNA was detected in 34% of 132 fleas, with seasonal variation, but without an association between the presence or the level of bacteremia in the corresponding cat. Cat fleas removed from bacteremic cattery cats transmitted B. henselae to five SPF kittens in two separate experiments; however, control SPF kittens housed with highly bacteremic kittens in the absence of fleas did not become infected. These data demonstrate that the cat flea readily transmits B. henselae to cats. Control of feline infestation with this arthropod vector may provide an important strategy for the prevention of infection of both humans and cats."

    "abstract": "The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) displays a unique hold and pull-feeding technique. Its delicate 'space-frame' skull morphology differs greatly from that apparent in most living large prey specialists and is suggestive of a high degree of optimization, wherein use of materials is minimized. Here, using high-resolution finite element modelling based on dissection and in vivo bite and pull data, we present results detailing the mechanical performance of the giant lizard's skull. Unlike most modern predators, V. komodoensis applies minimal input from the jaw muscles when butchering prey. Instead it uses series of actions controlled by postcranial muscles. A particularly interesting feature of the performance of the skull is that it reveals considerably lower overall stress when these additional extrinsic forces are added to those of the jaw adductors. This remarkable reduction in stress in response to additional force is facilitated by both internal and external bone anatomy. Functional correlations obtained from these analyses also provide a solid basis for the interpretation of feeding ecology in extinct species, including dinosaurs and sabre-tooth cats, with which V. komodoensis shares various cranial and dental characteristics."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A naturally occurring animal model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHCM) is lacking. We identified a family of Maine coon cats with HCM and developed a colony to determine mode of inheritance, phenotypic expression, and natural history of the disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A proband was identified, and related cats were bred to produce a colony. Affected and unaffected cats were bred to determine the mode of inheritance. Echocardiography was used to identify affected offspring and determine phenotypic expression. Echocardiograms were repeated serially to determine the natural history of the disease. Of 22 offspring from breeding affected to unaffected cats, 12 (55%) were affected. When affected cats were bred to affected cats, 4 (45%) of the 9 were affected, 2 (22%) unaffected, and 3 (33%) stillborn. Findings were consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with 100% penetrance, with the stillborns representing lethal homozygotes that died in utero. Affected cats usually did not have phenotypic evidence of HCM before 6 months of age, developed HCM during adolescence, and developed severe HCM during young adulthood. Papillary muscle hypertrophy that produced midcavitary obstruction and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve was the most consistent manifestation of HCM. Cats died suddenly (n=5) or of heart failure (n=3). Histopathology of the myocardium revealed myocardial fiber disarray, intramural coronary arteriosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: HCM in this family of Maine coon cats closely resembles the human form of FHCM and should prove a valuable tool for studying the gross, cellular, and molecular pathophysiology of the disease."

    "abstract": "Summary Hammondia hammondi gen.nov.,sp.nov. (Eimeriorina:Sarcocystidae) is described as an obligate heteroxenous protozoon of domestic cats (final host) and laboratory mice (experimental intermediate host). Oocysts from the final host are infectious only for the intermediate host; and cysts from the intermediate host are infectious only for the final host. Intracellular cysts develop principally in striated muscle of mice that ingest oocysts, with a few cysts in the brain and perhaps elsewhere. Cysts are without septa or radial spines; bradyzoites are slender, there is no evidence of metrocytes. Cysts are not infectious for mice. After the ingestion of cysts by cats, a multiplicative cycle precedes the development of gametocytes in the epithelium of the small intestine. Oocysts are shed unsporulated, sporogony is outside of the host, resulting in two sporocysts with four sporozoites each. Oocysts of the species average 11×13 µm. The prepatent period is 5 to 8 days, and oocyst shedding persists for 10 to 28 days followed by immunity. Cysts in skeletal muscle measured between 100 and 340 µm in length and 40 and 95 µm in width. Experimental intermediate hosts are laboratory mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, Peromyscus and Mastomys . Some of the intermediate hosts develop low levels of antibody and some cross-immunity against Toxoplasma ; however, this has not been observed in cats."

    "abstract": "The effect of pentoxifylline on regional cerebral ischemia was evaluated in 22 cats. In one group of 10 cats the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by a transorbital approach, and the cats were maintained on an intensive care protocol for 48 h. Pentoxifylline 10 mg.kg-1 initiated intravenously 30 min post-occlusion and followed by 6.3 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 48 h failed improve the neurologic outcome or infarct size when compared to controls. In another group of 12 cats with the same ischemic lesion, regional cerebral blood flow in the anterior (ischemic) area and an ipsilateral parieto-occipital region was measured by 133Xe wash-out after intra-arterial injection. MCA occlusion reduced the anterior flow by 50% from a mean control value of 62.7 ml.100 g-1.min-1 to 31.9 ml.100 g-1.min-1. The parieto-occipital flow was reduced by 20-30%, probably due to diaschisis. Pentoxifylline produced only a brief, although approximately 50%, increase in flow detected over both brain regions and failed to improve the cerebral energy stores as measured 150 min following MCA occlusion. From the neurologic, blood flow and metabolic data, it is concluded that pentoxifylline failed to affect cerebral ischemia favorably in cats."

A total of 120,406 pyrosequencing reads for bacteria (mean 5017) and 5359 sequences (one pool each for dogs and cats) for fungi were analyzed. Additionally, group-specific 16S rRNA gene clone libraries for Bifidobacterium spp. and lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB) were constructed. The most abundant bacterial phylum was Firmicutes, followed by Bacteroidetes in dogs and Actinobacteria in cats. The most prevalent bacterial class in dogs and cats was Clostridia, dominated by the genera Clostridium (clusters XIVa and XI) and Ruminococcus. At the genus level, 85 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in dogs and 113 OTUs in cats. Seventeen LAB and eight Bifidobacterium spp. were detected in canine feces. Ascomycota was the only fungal phylum detected in cats, while Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Zygomycota were identified in dogs. Nacaseomyces was the most abundant fungal genus in dogs; Saccharomyces and Aspergillus were predominant in cats. At the genus level, 33 different fungal OTUs were observed in dogs and 17 OTUs in cats. In conclusion, this study revealed a highly diverse bacterial and fungal microbiota in canine and feline feces."

    "abstract": "This cross-sectional telephone survey explored companion animal attachment and knowledge as well as cat care of residents in a small Texas town. The survey included 441 residents of randomly selected households (55% response rate). Dogs were owned by 48% of households and cats by 29%. Companion animal ownership was associated with being 25-44 years old, being Anglo, having an income over $85,000/year, and feeding unowned cats. More knowledge about animals was associated with being any age except 45-54 years old and with completing college or an advanced degree. Higher attachment was associated with being a woman and having no children in the household. Attachment and knowledge were not related to ethnicity. Cats were likely to be sterilized if they had been owned more than 2 years and had been rabies vaccinated. Outside-only cats were used to control vermin (\"mousers\") and were less likely to have visited a veterinarian. Cats with identification were likely to be from a shelter, frequently have visited the veterinarian, and been vaccinated against rabies. There are many companion animal owners who still do not have basic knowledge to prevent accidental litters or provide basic health care. Attachment scores for companion animal owners were similar to those previously reported and similar for cat and dog owners. A pattern of better care emerges for owners who view their cats as companions."

    "abstract": "At least two amphibian and 28 reptile taxa are considered to have become extinct since 1600. Almost all of them were island forms and were heavily exploited by man until their number was so low that it no longer paid to hunt them. In connection with the exploitation of the island fauna and flora, man brought with him various domestic animals. Some of them-cats, dogs, goats and pigs-became feral thus creating, together with introduced rats and mice, another serious threat to endemic animals. The deliberate introduction of the mongoose into the many islands of the West Indies amounted to a critical threat to forms which were not affected because of their economic value. At least in one case, mongoose were introduced into an island especially on purpose to get rid of the iguana and snakes. Man has also directly affected the existence of some forms by destruction of habitat and by shooting them for 'sport'. ?? 1981."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine when the muscles and joints of the forelimb become represented in primary motor cortex (M1) during postnatal life and how local representation patterns change. We examined these questions in cats that were anesthetized (45-90 days, n = 14; adults, n = 3) and awake (n = 4; 52-86 days). We used intracortical microstimulation (45 ms duration train, 330 Hz, 0.2-ms balanced biphasic pulses, with a leading cathodic pulse; up to 100 microA). In young animals (less than day 70), we also used stimulus trains and pulses that could produce greater temporal summation (up to 200-ms train duration, down to 143-Hz stimulus frequency, up to 0.8-ms pulse width). Anesthetized animals were areflexic, and muscle tone was similar to that of the awake cats (i.e., relaxed, not weight or load bearing, with minimal resistance to passive stretch). We monitored the kinematic effects of microstimulation and changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity in forelimb muscles. There was an age-dependent reduction in the number of sites where microstimulation did not produce a motor effect (i.e., ineffective sites), from 95% in animals younger than 60 days to 33% between 81 and 90 days. In adults, 24% of sites were ineffective. Median current thresholds for evoking movements dropped from 79 microA in animals younger than day 60 to 38 and 28 microA in day 81-90 animals and adults, respectively. There was a proximal-to-distal development of the somatotopic organization of the motor map. Stimulation at the majority of sites in animals younger than day 71 produced shoulder and elbow movement. Wrist sites were first present by day 71, and digit sites by day 81. Sites at which multiple responses were evoked, between 1.0 and 1.5 times threshold, were present after day 71, and increased with age. A higher percentage of distal joints were co-represented with other joints, rather than being represented alone. We found that effective sites initially were scattered and new sites representing proximal and distal joints filled in the gaps between effective sites. During most of the period examined, development of the caudal M1 subregion lagged that of the rostral subregion (percent of effective sites; threshold currents), although these differences were minimal or absent in adults. Our results show that the M1 motor representation is absent at day 45 and, during the subsequent month, the motor map is constructed by progressively representing more distal forelimb joints."

    "abstract": "The primary visual cortex (V1) is the first cortical area to receive visual input, and inferior temporal (IT) areas are among the last along the ventral visual pathway. We recorded, in area V1 of anaesthetized cats and area IT of awake macaque monkeys, responses of neurons to videos of natural scenes. Responses were analysed to test various hypotheses concerning the nature of neural coding in these two regions. A variety of spike-train statistics were measured including spike-count distributions, interspike interval distributions, coefficients of variation, power spectra, Fano factors and different sparseness measures. All statistics showed non-Poisson characteristics and several revealed self-similarity of the spike trains. Spike-count distributions were approximately exponential in both visual areas for eight different videos and for counting windows ranging from 50 ms to 5 seconds. The results suggest that the neurons maximize their information carrying capacity while maintaining a fixed long-term-average firing rate, or equivalently, minimize their average firing rate for a fixed information carrying capacity."

    "abstract": "AIM: To search for putative risk factors for feline hyperthyroidism in New Zealand, using a case-control study. METHODS: A questionnaire-based case-control study involving the owners of 375 cats in New Zealand (125 hyperthyroid cats, 125 randomly selected control cats, and 125 age- and sex-matched control cats) was conducted to examine associations between potential risk factors and occurrence of feline hyperthyroidism. Data were collected between December 1996 and February 1998, relative to cat and owner demography and medical history, cats' indoor and outdoor environments, and cats' diets. A range of statistical techniques was employed to analyse the data, including descriptive analyses, univariate logistic regression for each variable and multivariate stepwise forward logistic regression. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that affected cats were more likely to be female (odds ratio (OR)=3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.2-9.0) and older than unaffected random control cats. Purebred cats were at a much lower risk of being diagnosed as hyperthyroid than were domestic short- and long-haired cats (OR=0.01; 95% CI=0.001-0.20). If more than one cat was present in a household, hyperthyroidism was less likely to be identified (OR=0.15; 95% CI=0.05-0.44) compared with single-cat households. Hyperthyroid cats were 6.6 times more likely (95% CI=1.8-23.9) to be reported to sleep predominantly on the floor than control cats. Cats whose bedding was regularly treated with anti-flea products appeared to be at a considerably higher risk for hyperthyroidism (OR=57.6; 95% CI=3.8->200); and, to a lesser extent, so were cats living in households where fly sprays were reported to be used regularly (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.2-9.3). The interaction between drinking water from puddles and regular use of organic garden fertilisers, such as compost or animal manure, was associated with a 5.3-fold (95% CI=1.1-25.6) increase in the risk of cats being diagnosed with the disease. Hyperthyroid cats were twice as likely (95% CI=0.3-12.9) to have eaten at least half of their daily food requirements as canned commercial cat food compared with unaffected cats. Cats exposed to a variety of flavours of canned cat food were more likely to be diagnosed with hyperthyroidism than were those fed only one flavour (OR=3.8; 95% CI=1.5-9.6). The presence of dental disorders was associated with a 5.5-fold increase in the risk of being diagnosed as hyperthyroid and this association was independent of the cat's age (95% CI=1.7-17.5). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support and extend those in several earlier reports and show that cats in New Zealand are, in many respects, similar to cats in Europe and North America in terms of their susceptibility to hyperthyroidism. The finding that female cats are predisposed to hyperthyroidism is at variance with most previously published work. It remains unclear which, if any, of the identified disease associations are causal, so further studies of this increasingly prevalent feline endocrinopathy are warranted"

    "abstract": "Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) are the most abundant mammalian carnivores worldwide. Given that domestic carnivores rely on human-provided food, their densities are usually independent of prey densities. Nevertheless, underfed pets may need to hunt to meet their energetic and nutritional requirements. We explored the effects of different levels of care (provision of food) of dogs and cats on their predation rates on wild vertebrates in 2 areas of southern Chile. We interviewed cat and dog owners and analyzed prey remains in scats of pets to examine how domestic dogs and cats were managed and to gather information on the wild vertebrates killed and harassed by pets. We used logistic regression to examine the association between pet care and the frequency of wild vertebrate remains in scats. The probability of a dog preying on vertebrates was higher for poorly fed than for adequately fed dogs (odds ratio = 3.7) and for poorly fed than for adequately fed cats (odds ratio = 4.7). Domestic dogs and cats preyed on most endemic and threatened mammals present in the study sites. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the less care domestic animals receive from owners the higher the probability those animals will prey on wild vertebrates."

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the thorax is gaining more attention in veterinary medicine as therapeutic possibilities increase. Plain and contrast-enhanced CT images of the thorax of five referred cats with signs of respiratory disease were evaluated using soft tissue (pleural) and lung windows. The common CT pattern in all cats was involvement of the lung lobes, either as a homogeneous or heterogeneous single lobe hyperdensity. It involved the main bronchus, invaded the cranial or caudal mediastinum, and crossed the border to the opposite lung. Right lung atelectasis and mediastinal shift caused left lung overinflation. Bronchial lymph node enlargement was found unilaterally or bilaterally. CT-guided percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy of the lobar lung lesion was performed in four cats; in three cases it revealed carcinoma and in one inflammation, although the cat with suspected inflammation was subsequently found to have a carcinoma on lung lobectomy. Histopathology confirmed lung metastasis in one case and bronchial adenocarcinoma in four cases. A protocol for systematic examination of thoracic CT images is proposed."

    "abstract": "Jaguar and puma depredation on livestock may be influenced by (1) innate and learned behavior; (2) health and status of individual cats; (3) division of space and resources among jaguar and puma; (4) cattle husbandry practices; and (5) abundance and distribution of natural prey. Our study in Los Llanos of Venezuela aimed to establish how all these elements related to cattle being lost to cat depredation. Prey distribution was influenced by forest composition, topographical characteristics, and degree of habitat interspersion. The biomass of natural prey in the study area was adequate to support the resident large cats without a subsidy of livestock. Selective rather than opportunistic hunting by the cats reinforced that conclusion. Puma were responsible for more attacks on livestock than jaguar, frequently in maternity pastures in upland areas of relatively low prey availability. Management recommendations are discussed that may be relevant to other savanna/forest mosaics of South America."

    "abstract": "A retrospective survey from January 1989 to January 1999 of Tufts University Foster Hospital for Small Animals radiology records of 12 dogs and seven cats with cytologically or histopathologically confirmed abdominal mast cell disease was performed.Ultrasound changes in hepatic mast cell infiltration in dogs included a subjective increase in size, a diffuse increase in echogenicity, and one or more hypoechoic nodules. Ultrasound findings in the affected canine spleen included one or more hypoechoic nodules and a subjective increase in size. Two ultrasonographically unremarkable canine livers and one unremarkable spleen were found to be infiltrated by mast cells. The mast cell-infiltrated feline spleen was subjectively increased in size, mottled, irregular, or contained nodules. The affected lymph nodes in both dogs and cats were hypoechoic or inhomogeneous, subjectively increased in size, and rounded. Gastrointestinal involvement in cats was characterized by a thickened ileocecocolic junction or colon with loss of wall layering. Mast cells were not found in the gastrointestinal tract in any dog. One dog with mast cell infiltrate of the kidneys had multiple hypoechoic nodules in the cortex that distorted the outer contour of the kidney. Although these findings are not specific to the disease in either species, abdominal ultrasound is considered a useful tool for determining the extent of disease in small-animal patients with mast cell tumor if used in conjunction with histopathology or cytology"

    "abstract": "The development of ocular dominance columns has served as a Rosetta stone for understanding the mechanisms that guide the construction of cortical circuits. Traditionally, the emergence of ocular dominance columns was thought to be closely tied to the critical period, during which columnar architecture is highly susceptible to alterations in visual input. However, recent findings in cats, monkeys and ferrets indicate that columns develop far earlier, more rapidly and with considerably greater precision than was previously suspected. These observations indicate that the initial establishment of cortical functional architecture, and its subsequent plasticity during the critical period, are distinct developmental phases that might reflect distinct mechanisms."

    "abstract": "PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Although gait disturbance is one of the most common neurological presentations in feline medicine, the clinical approach to the paralyzed cat can be challenging. After excluding orthopedic and cardiovascular diseases that may mimic a neurological condition, the clinician has to address a long list of different diseases that may affect the spinal cord and produce paresis. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: In many cases a definitive cause of spinal weakness in cats is difficult to prove. Even when treatable diseases are identified, the prognosis is very much dependent on the severity of the clinical signs and their chronicity. This review sets out to describe the specific approach, diagnosis and management of cats with spinal cord disease and to outline the most common diseases responsible. PATIENT GROUP: Patients of either gender and all ages and breeds can be affected by spinal cord disease. EVIDENCE BASE: Many diseases affecting the spinal cord of cats, which include fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy, intervertebral disc disease, exogenous spinal cord trauma, spinal cord lymphosarcoma and feline infectious peritonitis, are well described in the literature. Many of these descriptions, however, have been based on case reports or series. While there have been several retrospective studies that describe the characteristics and incidence of these diseases in cats, there are no long term treatment trials or outcome studies to assist with prognostic determinations."

    "abstract": "The widespread occurrence of free-ranging domestic or feral carnivores (dogs, cats) or ungulates (pigs, goats), and massive releases of captive-reproduced game stocks (galliforms, waterfowl) is raising fear that introgressive hybridization with wild populations might disrupt local adaptations, leading to population decline and loss of biodiversity. Detecting introgression through hybridization is problematic if the parental populations cannot be sampled (unlike in classical stable hybrid zones), or if hybridization is sporadic. However, the use of hypervariable DNA markers (microsatellites) and new statistical methods (Bayesian models), have dramatically improved the assessment of cryptic population structure, admixture analyses and individual assignment testing. In this paper, I summarize results of projects aimed to identify occurrence and extent of introgressive hybridization in European populations of wolves (Canis lupus), wildcats (Felis silvestris), rock partridges and red-legged partridges (Alectoris graeca and Alectoris rufa), using genetic methods. Results indicate that introgressive hybridization can be locally pervasive, and that conservation plans should be implemented to preserve the integrity of the gene pools of wild populations. Population genetic methods can be fruitfully used to identify introgressed individuals and hybridizing populations, providing data which allow evaluating risks of outbreeding depression. The diffusion in the wild of invasive feral animals, and massive restocking with captive-reproduced game species, should be carefully controlled to avoid loss of genetic diversity and disruption of local adaptations."

Slow sinusoidal oscillations (0.2-0.3 Hz in aortic volume were produced by a piston pump connected to a femoral artery. Diastolic pressure-diameter relationship (PDR) curves were obtained during control conditions and during stimulation of either the cut central end of the left inferior cardiac nerve (ICN) or the decentralized thoracic sympathetic chain (SC). In six cats with both carotid arteries occluded ICN stimulation reflexly shifted the PDR curves to lower diameters for any given pressure (mean deltaAD 3.2% at control AP). A smaller response to ICN stimulation was obtained in five cats with one patent carotid artery (mean deltaAD 2.3% at control AP). Stimulation of sympathetic efferents to the aorta (SC) caused similar responses in five animals (mean deltaAD 3.4% at control AP). This reflex control of the thoracic aorta may be involved in cardioaortic coupling and may influence the sensitivity of aortic mechanoreceptors."

Mammals were the major prey in 499 scats that were analysed. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were the staple prey, while carrion was an important secondary food. Invertebrates, other mammalian prey, vegetation, birds and reptiles were generally minor components of the diet. Few significant seasonal differences in diet were found; however, invertebrates contributed less and possums more to the diet in winter and summer respectively. A significant dietary response was found to changes in rabbit abundance, but not for the other prey types. Cats continued to prey heavily on rabbits even after a 90% decline in rabbit abundance occurred, which coincided with the advent of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD). House mice (Mus domesticus) increased in importance in the diet ten months post-RCD. Although the abundance of cats was correlated with the abundance of some prey species, other factors may have influenced the observed patterns; these are discussed."

    "abstract": "Ectoparasites are a common and important cause of skin disorders in cats. Ectoparasites are capable of disease transmission and can cause life-threatening anemia in young or debilitated animals. The objective of this study was to determine the potential feline ectoparasites in domestic cats by using a cohort of feral cats from north central Florida that have not received veterinary care and have no known exposure to insecticide application. A total of 200 feral cats were randomly selected for this study. Four monthly sessions were scheduled for feral cat ectoparasite examination and sample collection. Five minutes flea combing revealed that 185/200 (92.5%) of the cats were infested with fleas. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis was the most common flea infesting 92.5% feral cats (mean=13.6; standard deviation$\\pm$16.4 fleas per cat). Pulex simulans was identified on 9/200 (4.5%) (mean=1$\\pm$0.50 fleas per cat). Echidnophaga gallinacea was found on 11/200 (5.5%) of cats (mean=14.8$\\pm$9.63 fleas per cat). There was a significant difference (P=0.0005) in the average number of C. felis counted per cat between months. Mean counts in June (18.3$\\pm$2.4) and July (16.6$\\pm$2.1) were significantly (P<0.01) higher than in August (8.4$\\pm$2.5) and September (7.7$\\pm$2.0). Only 15/200 cats had skin disease. Flea infestation may potentially be the underlying cause in 10/15. Otoscopic examination of both ears revealed mite movement and black ceruminous exudate typically indicative of the presence of Otodectes cynotis in 45/200 (22.5%) cats. Examination of a swab specimen from both ear canals of all cats revealed O. cynotis in 74/200 (37%) cats. Of 74 cats positive on ear swab, 8 (10.8%) showed a normal ear canal appearance (no or mild ceruminous exudate) in both ears upon otoscopic examination. A total of nine ticks were recovered from five cats. The number and species of ticks recovered were: one adult female Rhipicephalus sanguineus; one adult female Amblyomma americanum; one adult male A. americanum; five adult female Dermacentor variabilis; and one adult female Ixodes scapularis. All superficial skin scrapes were negative. Hair clippings from the abdomen of all cats revealed 2/200 (1%) of the cats were infested with Felicola subrostratus."

    "abstract": "Hochberg and co-workers have predicted that an increase in host adult mortality due to parasites is balanced by an earlier age at first reproduction. In polygynous species we hypothesize that such a pattern would lead to diverging selection pressure on body size between sexes and increased sexual size dimorphism. In polygynous mammals, male body size is considered to be an important factor for reproductive success. Thus, under the pressure of a virulent infection, males should be selected for rapid growth and/or higher body size to be able to compete successfully as soon as possible with opponents. In contrast, under the same selection pressure, females should be selected for lighter adult body size or rapid growth to reach sexual maturity earlier. We investigated this hypothesis in the domestic cat Felis catus. Orange cats have greater body size dimorphism than non-orange cats. Orange females are lighter than non-orange females, and orange males are heavier than non-orange males. Here, we report the extent to which orange and non-orange individuals differ in infection prevelance for two retroviruses, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). FIV is thought to be transmitted almost exclusively through aggressive contacts between individuals, whereas FeLV transmission occurs mainly through social contacts. The pattern of infection of both diseases is consistent with the higher aggressiveness of orange cats. In both sexes, orange cats are significantly more infected by FIV, and tend to be less infected by FeLV than other cats. The pattern of infection is also consistent with an earlier age at first reproduction in orange than in non-orange cats, at least for females. These results suggest that microparasitism may have played an important role in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism of domestic cats."

    "abstract": "1. Vision was investigated with behavioural and electrophysiological techniques in three groups of cats: (a) two normally raised kittens in which one eye was rotated at an age of 3 months, (b) three adult cats in which one eye had been rotated and the other closed 6 months prior to recording, (c) two adult cats in which first one eye had been rotated and the other closed and subsequently, after one year, the rotated eye had been closed and the normal eye re‐opened. The latter two cats were investigated 6 and 12 months after reverse suture, respectively. All adult cats were at least 2 years old when operated on for the first time.    2. Behavioural analysis revealed that the kittens of the first group no longer used the rotated eye for fixation, visuo‐motor behaviour being impaired when tested through this eye. Binocularity was found to be disrupted to nearly the same extent as in kittens made strabismic at the beginning of the critical period. In addition, ocular dominance was shifted towards the normal eye.    3. The adult cats in the second group developed a virtually complete neglect of the visual modality subsequent to a period of severely disturbed visuo‐motor behaviour.    4. These behavioural abnormalities were associated with clear alterations in the functional state of striate cortex. Only 47% of the recorded cells could be driven with light, the majority of these reactive neurones yielding only sluggish responses to optimally aligned stimuli. The ocular dominance distribution showed a significant reduction of binocular cells but gave no indication of a shift in ocular dominance towards either of the two eyes. Moreover, contrast sensitivity as assessed with pattern‐evoked potentials was significantly reduced.    5. The remaining two animals that were reverse sutured after the visual neglect had developed showed complete behavioural recovery when tested through the re‐opened normal eye. However, this recovery was not instantaneous and occurred only after the cats had been forced to use their visual sense.    6. Behavioural recovery was paralleled by an increase of cortical reactivity to normal levels and by a marked increase in binocularity. This gain increase of excitatory transmission was, however, selective for neurones dominated by the normal eye, leading to a bias in ocular dominance towards this eye.    7. The observed modifications in the functional state of striate cortex indicate that reversible changes in the gain of excitatory transmission can still occur beyond the end of the classical critical period. These long‐lasting changes in synaptic efficiency appear to follow the rules postulated by Hebb for adaptive synaptic connexions.   © 1982 The Physiological Society"

    "abstract": "Using single and multiunit recordings in the striate cortex of alert macaque monkeys, we find that gamma-band (20-70 Hz) oscillations in neuronal firing are a prominent feature of V1 neuronal activity. The properties of this rhythmic activity are very similar to those previously observed in the cat. Gamma-band activity is strongly dependent on visual stimulation, largely absent during spontaneous activity and, under the conditions of our experiment, not time-locked to the vertical refresh of the computer monitor (80 Hz) used to present the stimuli. In our sample, 61% of multiunit activity (MUA) and 46% of single-unit activity (SUA) was significantly oscillatory, with mean frequencies of 48+/-9 and 42+/-13 Hz, respectively. Gamma-band activity was most likely to occur when cells were activated by their optimal stimuli, but still occurred, although less often and with lower amplitude, in response to nonoptimal stimuli. The frequency of gamma-band activity also reflected stimulus properties, with drifting gratings evoking higher-frequency oscillations than stationary gratings. As in the cat, the spike trains of single cells showing gamma-band oscillations often displayed a pattern of repetitive burst firing, with intraburst firing rates of 300-800 Hz. The overall similarity of rhythmic neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys suggests that the phenomenon is not species-specific. The stimulus-dependence of the rhythmic activity is consistent with a functional role in visual perception."

    "abstract": "Micturition was evoked in conscious cats by infusing saline into the bladder at a physiological rate. Drugs were administered intrathecally. Micturition volume threshold was increased by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) and decreased by zatosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, in spinally intact cats. Thus 5-HT3 receptors inhibit micturition. After complete spinal transection, serotonin reduced volume threshold in 3 of 4 cats, indicating an alteration in serotonergic control. However, 2-methyl-5-HT, a 5-HT3 receptor agonist, increased volume threshold. Thus 5-HT3 receptor-mediated inhibition of bladder function remains after spinal transection. We conclude that some, but not all, serotonergic modulation of bladder function is altered after spinal transection."

    "abstract": "The relationship of charge density per phase, or QD/ph (expressed in units of microcoulombs per cm2 per phase of the charge-balanced wave form), and total charge (QD1) to neural damage has been investigated by light and electron microscopy after surface stimulation of the parietal cortex in normal cats. QD/ph values ranging from 40 to 400 were achieved by varying several stimulus parameters. The least amount of neural damage in this study was observed at QD/ph 40. The extent of neural injury at stimulated sites increased with the charge density and was evident as disruption of cell membranes, intracytoplasmic vacuolation, and increasing glycogen content, the deposition of intracellular calcium hydroxyapatite, and neuronal and astrocytic degeneration. Although individual factors contributing to neural damage are isolated with difficulty, charge density and total charge seem to be predominant among the contributing parameters. In view of these findings, recommendations have been made for the selection of electrical stimulus parameters to be used in central nervous system prostheses."

    "abstract": "Previous experiments have demonstrated that the vestibular system contributes to regulating sympathetic nervous system activity, particularly the discharges of vasoconstrictor fibres. In the present study, we examined the physiological significance of vestibulosympathetic responses by comparing blood flow and vascular resistance in the forelimb and hindlimb during head-up tilt from the prone position before and after the removal of vestibular inputs through a bilateral vestibular neurectomy. Experiments were performed on conscious cats that were trained to remain sedentary on a tilt table during rotations up to 60 deg in amplitude. Blood flow through the femoral and brachial arteries was recorded during whole-body tilt using perivascular probes; blood pressure was recorded using a telemetry system and vascular resistance was calculated from blood pressure and blood flow measurements. In vestibular-intact animals, 60 deg head-up tilt produced ~20% decrease in femoral blood flow and ~37% increase in femoral vascular resistance relative to baseline levels before tilt; similar effects were also observed for the brachial artery (~25% decrease in blood flow and ~38% increase in resistance). Following the removal of vestibular inputs, brachial blood flow and vascular resistance during head-up tilt were almost unchanged. In contrast, femoral vascular resistance increased only ~6% from baseline during 60 deg head-up rotation delivered in the first week after elimination of vestibular signals and ~16% in the subsequent 3-week period (as opposed to the ~37% increase in resistance that occurred before lesion). These data demonstrate that vestibular inputs associated with postural alterations elicit regionally specific increases in vascular resistance that direct blood flow away from the region of the body where blood pooling may occur. Thus, the data support the hypothesis that vestibular influences on the cardiovascular system serve to protect against the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. 2006 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Data from intravenous (i.v.) glucose tolerance tests suggest that glucose clearance from the blood is slower in cats than in dogs. Since different physiological pathways are activated following oral administration compared with i.v. administration, we investigated the profiles of plasma glucose and insulin in cats and dogs following ingestion of a test meal with or without glucose. Adult male and female cats and dogs were fed either a high-protein (HP) test meal (15 g/kg body weight; ten cats and eleven dogs) or a HP + glucose test meal (13 g/kg body-weight HP diet + 2 g/kg body-weight D-glucose; seven cats and thirteen dogs) following a 24 h fast. Marked differences in plasma glucose and insulin profiles were observed in cats and dogs following ingestion of the glucose-loaded meal. In cats, mean plasma glucose concentration reached a peak at 120 min (10.2, 95 % CI 9.7, 10.8 mmol/l) and returned to baseline by 240 min, but no statistically significant change in plasma insulin concentration was observed. In dogs, mean plasma glucose concentration reached a peak at 60 min (6.3, 95 % CI 5.9, 6.7 mmol/l) and returned to baseline by 90 min, while plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher than pre-meal values from 30 to 120 min following the glucose-loaded meal. These results indicate that cats are not as efficient as dogs at rapidly decreasing high blood glucose levels and are consistent with a known metabolic adaptation of cats, namely a lack of glucokinase, which is important for both insulin secretion and glucose uptake from the blood."

    "abstract": "A recent controversy has emerged concerning the existence of long pauses, presumably reflecting bistability of membrane potential, in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) of awake animals. It is generally agreed that in the anesthetized animals and in vitro, these cells switch between two stable membrane potential states: a depolarized state (the 'up-state') characterized by continuous firing of simple spikes (SS) and a hyperpolarized state (the 'down-state') characterized by long pauses in the SS activity. To address the existence of long pauses in the neural activity of cerebellar PCs in the awake and behaving animal we used extracellular recordings in cats and find that approximately half of the recorded PCs exhibit such long pauses in the SS activity and transition between activity - periods with uninterrupted SS lasting an average of 1300 ms - and pauses up to several seconds. We called these cells pausing Purkinje cells (PPC) and they can easily be distinguished from continuous firing Purkinje cells. In most PPCs, state transitions in both directions were often associated (25% of state transitions) with complex spikes (CSs). This is consistent with intracellular findings of CS-driven state transitions. In sum, we present proof for the existence of long pauses in the PC SS activity that probably reflect underlying bistability, provide the first in-depth analysis of these pauses and show for the first time that transitions in and out of these pauses are related to CS firing in the awake and behaving animal."

    "abstract": "Published data on aspects of domestic pet demographics are available in many countries. Several of these studies have linked household demographics, such as the presence of children in the household, to pet ownership. There is very little published information about the demography of domestic pets on the island of Ireland (the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland). This study was conducted to describe the demography of the pet dog and cat populations on the island of Ireland and to identify human factors influencing pet ownership. A questionnaire was designed and administered to households to collect data about the demographics of households and their dogs and cats. The questions related to location, building structure, social class, nationality and family structure of the household, and the sex, age and source of each pet dog and/or cat. The survey was administered by a commercial company, using computer-assisted telephone interview techniques to 1250 households selected using random digit dialling and quota controls. In this study, a pet dog was defined as a dog that was been fed by a household and considered a pet by the participant of the study. A pet cat was defined as a cat that was both fed by the household and allowed into the house. The results show that 35.6% of households in Ireland have one or more pet dogs and 10.4% of households have one or more pet cats. In total, 47.3% of pet dogs and 76.1% of pet cats were neutered. Females of both species are more likely to be neutered than males. Factors associated with dog ownership included location, house type, household social class, household composition, the presence of school children in the house, and the presence of a cat in the house. Factors associated with pet cat ownership included the type of house structure, the presence of a dog in the house and the gender and age of the participant. Cats tend to stray into households. This study was the first to provide detailed information about the demographics of the pet dog and cat populations on the island of Ireland, and has identified areas for further research, in particular the effect of stray dogs and cats on the owned pet dog and cat population, and of future demographic trends in these populations."

    "abstract": "The objective of this article is to review the recent literature that reports on the most common diseases affecting the spinal cord of cats, and to draw some general conclusions that will be useful to formulate diagnosis and prognosis for feline spinal patients. The most common types of feline spinal cord diseases documented were inflammatory/infectious diseases, and feline infectious peritonitis was the most common disease, representing approximately 50% of all feline myelitis. Neoplasms were documented in approximately 25% of cases; lymphosarcoma was the most common tumor affecting the spinal cord of cats, with reported prevalence between 28% and 40%. Cats diagnosed with spinal lymphosarcoma were significantly younger (median age 4 years) than cats with other spinal cord tumors (median age 10 years). Cats with clinical signs of intervertebral disc disease had a median age of 8 years, and 67% had Hansen type I disc protrusions. The most commonly affected intervertebral disc was at the L4 to L5 intervertebral disc space. Fibrocartilaginous embolism-affected older cats (median age 10 years), seemed to predominate in the cervicothoracic intumescence, and clinical signs were markedly lateralized, especially when the cervical region was affected."

    "abstract": "The invasion of ecosystems by exotic species is currently viewed as one of the most important sources of biodiversity loss. The largest part of this loss occurs on islands, where indigenous species have often evolved in the absence of strong competition, herbivory, parasitism or predation. As a result, introduced species thrive in those optimal insular ecosystems affecting their plant food, competitors or animal prey. As islands are characterised by a high rate of endemism, the impacted populations often correspond to local subspecies or even unique species. One of the most important taxa concerning biological invasions on islands is mammals. A small number of mammal species is responsible for most of the damage to invaded insular ecosystems: rats, cats, goats, rabbits, pigs and a few others. The effect of alien invasive species may be simple or very complex, especially since a large array of invasive species, mammals and others, can be present simultaneously and interact among themselves as well as with the indigenous species. In most cases, introduced species generally have a strong impact and they often are responsible for the impoverishment of the local flora and fauna. The best response to these effects is almost always to control the alien population, either by regularly reducing their numbers, or better still, by eradicating the population as a whole from the island. Several types of methods are currently used: physical (trapping, shooting), chemical (poisoning) and biological (e.g. directed use of diseases). Each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, depending on the mammal species targeted. The best strategy is almost always to combine several methods. Whatever the strategy used, its long-term success is critically dependent on solid support from several different areas, including financial support, staff commitment, and public support, to name only a few. In many cases, the elimination of the alien invasive species is followed by a rapid and often spectacular recovery of the impacted local populations. However, in other cases, the removal of the alien is not sufficient for the damaged ecosystem to revert to its former state, and complementary actions, such as species re-introduction, are required. A third situation may be widespread: the sudden removal of the alien species may generate a further disequilibrium, resulting in further or greater damage to the ecosystem. Given the numerous and complex population interactions among island species, it is difficult to predict the outcome of the removal of key species, such as a top predator. This justifies careful pre-control study and preparation prior to initiating the eradication of an alien species, in order to avoid an ecological catastrophe. In addition, long-term monitoring ofthe post-eradication ecosystem is crucial to assess success and prevent reinvasion."

    "abstract": "Neutering is often associated with obesity in companion animals. However, the maintenance energy requirement (MER) for these animals has not been clearly defined. The present study investigated the MER for spayed cats whose body weights (BW) began to increase shortly after ovariohysterectomy. A total of twenty-two shorthair adult female cats were fed complete and balanced diets in amounts to maintain their BW and body condition score (BCS) before the present study. All cats were spayed and the diet was fed for 11 weeks using the same MER as previously. During these weeks, all cats gained weight. Beginning with week 12, a weight-loss regimen was initiated until each cat achieved a BCS of 5 out of 9. After each cat obtained a BCS of 5, an appropriate amount of diet was fed to maintain its BW for at least 4 weeks to determine a modified MER. Daily food consumption, weekly BW and BCS were monitored. Blood was collected before and after weight loss for plasma biochemistry profiles. BW and BCS increased by 16 % and one point (P < 0·01), respectively, during the first 11 weeks after surgery, although food consumption was constant both pre- and post-surgery. The mean MER after obtaining a BCS of 5 was 313·6 (sem 23·6) kJ/BW0·67, which is 25 % lower than the current National Research Council recommendation and lower than the cat's requirement before surgery (P < 0·05). In conclusion, spaying significantly increased BW when using MER values for intact cats. Thus, 313·6 × ideal BW0·67 kJ is proposed for the MER of spayed adult cats."

    "abstract": "The ability to recognize sounds allows humans and animals to efficiently detect behaviorally relevant events, even in the absence of visual information. Sound recognition in the human brain has been assumed to proceed through several functionally specialized areas, culminating in cortical modules where category-specific processing is carried out. In the present high-resolution fMRI experiment, we challenged this model by using well-controlled natural auditory stimuli and by employing an advanced analysis strategy based on an iterative machine-learning algorithm that allows modeling of spatially distributed, as well as localized, response patterns. Sounds of cats, female singers, acoustic guitars, and tones were controlled for their time-varying spectral characteristics and presented to subjects at three different pitch levels. Sound category information--not detectable with conventional contrast-based methods analysis--could be detected with multivoxel pattern analyses and attributed to spatially distributed areas over the supratemporal cortices. A more localized pattern was observed for processing of pitch laterally to primary auditory areas. Our findings indicate that distributed neuronal populations within the human auditory cortices, including areas conventionally associated with lower-level auditory processing, entail categorical representations of sounds beyond their physical properties."

    "abstract": "Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) are isolated from man and farm animals but also from dogs and cats. They produce typical histological lesions called 'attaching and effacing' lesions. Both plasmid and chromosomal elements are involved in the pathogenesis of EPEC infection. The presence of these genetic elements was investigated in 14 dog and three cat EPEC isolates. A bfpA-related gene was detected in five of the 17 isolates in association with high molecular weight plasmids, and a locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) was present in all isolates. The LEE was inserted in the selC region in only 12% of the isolates. The eae, tir, espA and espB genes were analyzed by multiplex PCR. The results indicated the presence of those genes in the tested isolates with heterogeneity in the gene subtypes present: eae gamma-tir alpha-espA alpha-espB alpha (65%), eae beta-tir beta-espA beta-espB beta (29%), eae alpha-tir alpha-espA alpha-espB alpha (6%). Moreover, the espD gene was also present in dog and cat EPEC. The DEPEC and CEPEC form a heterogeneous group and five of them are closely related to human EPEC."

    "abstract": "The majority of techniques for separating multiple single-unit spike trains from a multi-unit recording rely on the assumption that different cells exhibit action potentials having unique amplitudes and waveforms. When this assumption fails, due to the similarity of spike shape among different cells or to the presence of complex spikes with declining intra-burst amplitude, these methods lead to errors in classification. In an effort to avoid these errors, the stereotrode (McNaughton et al., 1983) and later the tetrode (O'Keefe and Reece, 1993; Wilson and McNaughton, 1993) recording techniques were developed. Because the latter technique has been applied primarily to the hippocampus, we sought to evaluate its performance in the neocortex. Multi-unit recordings, using single tetrodes, were made at 28 sites in area 17 of 3 anesthetized cats. Neurons were activated with moving bars and square wave gratings. Single units were separated by identification of clusters in 2-D projections of either peak-to-peak amplitude, spike width, spike area, or the 1st versus 2nd principal components of the waveforms recorded on each channel. Using tetrodes, we recorded a total of 154 single cells (mean = 5.4, max = 9). By cross-checking the performance of the tetrode with the stereotrode and electrode, we found that the best of the 6 possible stereotrode pairs and the best of 4 possible electrodes from each tetrode yielded 102 (mean = 3.6, max = 7) and 95 (mean = 3.4, max = 6) cells, respectively. Moreover, we found that the number of cells isolated at each site by the tetrode was greater than the stereotrode or electrode in 16/28 and 28/28 cases, respectively. Thus, both stereotrodes, and particularly electrodes, often lumped 2 or more cells in a single cluster that could be easily separated by the tetrode. We conclude that tetrode recording currently provides the best and most reliable method for the isolation of multiple single units in the neocortex using a single probe."

    "abstract": "In mammals, the perception of motion starts with direction-selective neurons in the visual cortex. Despite numerous studies in monkey primary and second visual cortex (V1 and V2), there has been no evidence of direction maps in these areas. In the present study, we used optical imaging methods to study the organization of motion response in macaque V1 and V2. In contrast to the findings in other mammals (e.g., cats and ferrets), we found no direction maps in macaque V1. Robust direction maps, however, were found in V2 thick/pale stripes and avoided thin stripes. In many cases direction maps were located within thick stripes and exhibited pinwheel or linear organizations. The presence of motion maps in V2 points to a newfound prominence of V2 in motion processing, for contributing to motion perception in the dorsal pathway and/or for motion cue-dependent form perception in the ventral pathway."

All cats had relapsed or resistant lymphoma. Two fractions of radiation were delivered over 2 days for a total of 800cGy. Acute effects of radiation were not noted, except one cat that had a self-limiting loss of appetite. Response was noted in 10/11 cats. Median survival post-radiation therapy was 214 days and the overall median survival in this study was 355 days. This study suggests that abdominal irradiation for feline gastrointestinal lymphoma was well tolerated and may contribute to a positive clinical response."

    "abstract": "Among the 37 living species of Felidae, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is generally classified as a monotypic genus basal to the Panthera lineage of great cats [1-5]. This secretive, mid-sized (16-23 kg) carnivore, now severely endangered, is traditionally subdivided into four southeast Asian subspecies (Figure 1A) [4-8]. We used molecular genetic methods to re-evaluate subspecies partitions and to quantify patterns of population genetic variation among 109 clouded leopards of known geographic origin (Figure 1A, Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data available online). We found strong phylogeographic monophyly and large genetic distances between N. n. nebulosa (mainland) and N. n. diardi (Borneo; n = 3 individuals) with mtDNA (771 bp), nuclear DNA (3100 bp), and 51 microsatellite loci. Thirty-six fixed mitochondrial and nuclear nucleotide differences and 20 microsatellite loci with nonoverlapping allele-size ranges distinguished N. n. nebulosa from N. n. diardi. Along with fixed subspecies-specific chromosomal differences, this degree of differentiation is equivalent to, or greater than, comparable measures among five recognized Panthera species (lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard). These distinctions increase the urgency of clouded leopard conservation efforts, and if affirmed by morphological analysis and wider sampling of N. n. diardi in Borneo and Sumatra, would support reclassification of N. n. diardi as a new species (Neofelis diardt)."

    "abstract": "The role of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) in directional hearing was evaluated by measuring sound localization behaviors before and after cats received lesions of the dorsal and intermediate acoustic striae (DAS/IAS). These lesions are presumed to disrupt spectral processing in the DCN without affecting binaural time and level difference cues that exit the cochlear nucleus via the ventral acoustic stria. Prior to DAS/IAS lesions, cats made accurate head orientation responses toward sound sources in the frontal sound field. After a unilateral DAS/IAS lesion, subjects showed increased errors in the azimuth and elevation of their responses; in addition, the final orientation of head movements tended to be more variable. Largest deficits in response elevation were observed in the hemifield that was ipsilateral to the lesion. When a second lesion was placed in the opposite DAS/IAS, increased orientation errors were observed throughout the frontal field. Nonetheless, bilaterally lesioned cats showed normal discrimination of changes in sound source location when tested with a spatial acuity task. These findings support previous interpretations that the DCN contributes to sound orientation behavior, and further suggest that the identification of absolute sound source locations and the discrimination between spatial locations involve independent auditory processing mechanisms."

Another multi-billion-dollar international market that needs exploration flows from the highly-involving bonds between humans and their horses. Horses are not pets, but the study of equine relationships with humans generates insights into animal-companion interactions. This article reports results of an interpretive phenomenological investigation of the relationship between humans and their horses, using participant observations, in-depth interviews, and written open-ended questions including the critical-incident technique. Analysis of the data first addresses a priori themes from the animal-companionship literature and identifies themes found, themes with a twist, and themes not found. The article then discusses seven emergent themes unique to human-horse relationships - including physicality, partnership, bonding through adversity, flow experience, communitas, spirituality, and life lessons.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to measure the spatial thickness distribution of the cat tympanic membrane (TM), a very thin, virtually transparent and delicate biological membrane. Axial fluorescence images taken perpendicular through isolated TM were recorded for five different cats using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Thickness was measured on the cross-section of the membranes in the axial images. A correction for focal shift due to refractive-index mismatch was applied. Similar thickness distributions were obtained in all measured samples (n = 9). The pars tensa had a rather constant thickness in the central region between the annulus and manubrium. The thickness increased steeply toward the peripheral rim. Thickness was smallest in the inferior region, with values ranging between 5.5 and 9 microm in the central part and up to 50 microm near the annulus. More superiorly, thickness was slightly higher, up to 20 microm, between the annulus and manubrium. The anterior part was thicker than the posterior side. These findings are strongly different from a current value in the literature. Our data allow a more precise representation of the eardrum in mathematical models, which are a prerequisite for a better understanding of middle-ear mechanics. The optical sectioning technique of the confocal microscope did not result in any preparation artifacts and was therefore also used to quantify shrinkage due to preparation of histological sections of TMs."

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological studies in cats and recently in rats implicate neuroplasticity in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and its afferents in stressor-induced increases in fearful behavior and anxiety-like behavior (ALB). Such increases may model aspects of affective changes following traumatic stress in humans. The present study explored the role of neuroplasticity in PAG and its connection with the central nucleus of the amygdala (ACE) in male rodent anxiety-like response to predator stress. In the first of two studies, the effects of predator stress on the induction of phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein (pCREB) were investigated. pCREB expression in the PAG and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) was examined immunohistochemically. Predator stress increased the degree of pCREB expression in PAG cells (measured densitometrically) but did not increase the number of cells expressing pCREB (measured stereologically). Moreover, predator stress-specific increase in pCREB-like immunoreactivity (lir) was restricted to the right lateral column of the PAG. In addition, pCREB lir in the right lateral column likely reflects aspects of the stress experience because the stressor (cat behavior) and the response to the stressor (rat defensive behavior) are highly predictive of degree of pCREB expression. There was no effect of predator stress on pCREB lir in the VMH. Because pCREB expression has been associated with long-lasting potentiation (LLP) of neural transmission, we examined the effects of predator stress on transmission in the ACE-PAG pathway in a second study. Predator stress elevated evoked potential measures of ACE-PAG transmission in the right hemisphere but not in the left hemisphere 11-12 days after predator stress. This finding is consistent with the longer-lived effects of pharmacological stress on amygdalo-PAG transmission in the right hemisphere but not in the left hemisphere in cats. Of interest is the fact that the same aspects of the stressor experience and reaction to it, which are predictive of the degree of pCREB expression, are also highly predictive of the degree of potentiation of measures of ACE-PAG transmission. Behavioral analyses revealed that the most consistent effects of predator stress are on behavior in the plus maze (open arm exploration and risk assessment) and on startle. In addition, covariance analysis suggests that ACE-PAG potentiation mediates some but not all of the changes in ALB produced by predator stress. Because pCREB expression may be a precursor to neuroplastic changes in certain forms of memory and LLP, the present findings complement studies in the cat, showing that neuroplastic changes in the PAG underlie changes in affect following stress. Furthermore, these findings suggest that neuroplastic changes in PAG may be important mediators of predator stress-induced changes in affective behavior in rodents. Finally, consistent with cat and human studies, the right hemisphere appears particularly important in long-term response to stress."

    "abstract": "Artificial selection is the selection of advantageous natural variation for human ends and is the mechanism by which most domestic species evolved. Most domesticates have their origin in one of a few historic centers of domestication as farm animals. Two notable exceptions are cats and dogs. Wolf domestication was initiated late in the Mesolithic when humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Those wolves less afraid of humans scavenged nomadic hunting camps and over time developed utility, initially as guards warning of approaching animals or other nomadic bands and soon thereafter as hunters, an attribute tuned by artificial selection. The first domestic cats had limited utility and initiated their domestication among the earliest agricultural Neolithic settlements in the Near East. Wildcat domestication occurred through a self-selective process in which behavioral reproductive isolation evolved as a correlated character of assortative mating coupled to habitat choice for urban environments. Eurasian wildcats initiated domestication and their evolution to companion animals was initially a process of natural, rather than artificial, selection over time driven during their sympatry with forbear wildcats."

    "abstract": "A recent major conceptual advance has been the recognition of the importance of immune system-neuronal interactions in the modulation of brain function, one example of which is spinal pain processing in neuropathic states. Here, we report that in peripheral nerve-injured rats, the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin S (CatS) is critical for the maintenance of neuropathic pain and spinal microglia activation. After injury, CatS was exclusively expressed by activated microglia in the ipsilateral dorsal horn, where expression peaked at day 7, remaining high on day 14. Intrathecal delivery of an irreversible CatS inhibitor, morpholinurea-leucine-homophenylalanine-vinyl phenyl sulfone (LHVS), was antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic in neuropathic rats and attenuated spinal microglia activation. Consistent with a pronociceptive role of endogenous CatS, spinal intrathecal delivery of rat recombinant CatS (rrCatS) induced hyperalgesia and allodynia in naïve rats and activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in spinal cord microglia. A bioinformatics approach revealed that the transmembrane chemokine fractalkine (FKN) is a potential substrate for CatS cleavage. We show that rrCatS incubation reduced the levels of cell-associated FKN in cultured sensory neurons and that a neutralizing antibody against FKN prevented both FKN- and CatS-induced allodynia, hyperalgesia, and p38 MAPK activation. Furthermore, rrCatS induced allodynia in wild-type but not CX3CR1-knockout mice. We suggest that under conditions of increased nociception, microglial CatS is responsible for the liberation of neuronal FKN, which stimulates p38 MAPK phosphorylation in microglia, thereby activating neurons via the release of pronociceptive mediators."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare cutaneous disorder, characterized by vascular calcification and progressive skin necrosis, not yet described in cats. It is scarcely reported in animals, mostly due to iatrogenic or uraemic disturbances of the calcium-phosphate balance. In human patients, it is most commonly seen with end-stage renal disease, but several nonuraemic disorders, including inherited dysfunctions of tissue calcification inhibitors, have also been described.\\n\\nHYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of nonuraemic calciphylaxis in a cat.\\n\\nANIMALS: A 10-week-old male domestic short hair kitten was presented with hyperacute skin lesions. Initial dermatological signs were characterized by sharp demarcated erosions and ulcerations on the face, including the nasal planum and lips. Cutaneous lesions rapidly progressed into thick crusts with ulcerations, involving parts of the face and pinna as well as abdominal skin.\\n\\nMETHODS: Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, urinalysis, parathyroid hormone measurement and histopathological examination of skin biopsies.\\n\\nRESULTS: Histopathology from newly developed abdominal skin lesions revealed severe epidermal necrosis and calcification, multifocal pannicular calcification and calcified subcutaneous vessels, supporting a diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Treatment consisted of systemic and topical antimicrobials, analgesics, pentoxifylline, Lantharenol(®) , sodium thiosulfate and vitamin K. After initiation of therapy, no further progression was noticed; all medications could be discontinued eventually, and no relapse was seen in the following 2 years.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Calciphylaxis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for ulcerative cutaneous disorders in young cats. More information on this disease is needed to elucidate the pathomechanism."

    "abstract": "Medical records for 92 cats with a vaccine associated sarcoma receiving preoperative irradiation, with or without chemotherapy, between December 1985 and September 1998 were reviewed. The purposes were to quantify response to treatment and to attempt identification of factors associated with favorable response. Variables evaluated for a relationship to outcome included signalment, tumor location, presence of gross vs. microscopic tumor, radiation field size, irradiation technique, type of surgical procedure, completeness of excision, and chemotherapy (none, carboplatin alone, and others). Time to first event was calculated for the first day of treatment until local tumor recurrence or metastasis, or the date of euthanasia or death. Median time to first event for all 92 cats was 584 days. Only completeness of surgical excision was related to the time to first event. Median time to first event in cats having complete surgical excision was 986 days compared to 292 days for cats with incomplete excision (P = 0.004). Cats requiring bone removal to effect tumor removal had earlier failure than cats having other types of surgery. There was not a significant relationship between administration of chemotherapy or chemotherapy type and time to first event although outcome in cats receiving carboplatin was better than all other treatment groups. Carboplatin addition to preoperative irradiation appears worthy of further study. Preoperative irradiation is an effective treatment for cats with vaccine associated sarcoma, especially if complete excision can be accomplished following irradiation."

Reference values for onset latency and peak-to-peak amplitude of magnetic motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) were obtained and compared with values of electric motor evoked potentials (EMEPs) in 10/40 cats. Onset latencies and peak-to-peak amplitudes of the MMEPs of three cats with polyneuropathy (PNP) were compared to the reference values. Magnetic motor evoked responses were easily recorded in all normal cats. Significant differences were found in onset latencies between MMEPs and EMEPs, but peak-to-peak amplitudes were equal. The MMEPs of three cats with PNP can be seen as outliers in comparison to the reference values. MMEPs from the RN and SN were easily obtained and reproducible in normal cats. The technique could represent a useful adjunct in the assessment of peripheral nerve disorders."

    "abstract": "Although there have been many anatomical, physiological, and psychophysical studies of auditory development in cat, there have been no comparable studies of the development of the sound pressured transformations by the cat head and pinnae. Because the physical dimensions of the head and pinnae determine the spectral and temporal transformations of sound, as head and pinnae size increase during development, the magnitude and frequency ranges of these transformations are hypothesized to systematically change. This hypothesis was tested by measuring directional transfer functions (DTFs), the directional components of head-related transfer functions, and the linear dimensions of the head and pinnae in cats from the onset of hearing ( approximately 1.5 weeks) through adulthood. Head and pinnae dimensions increased by factors of approximately 2 and approximately 2.5, respectively, reaching adult values by approximately 23 and approximately 16 weeks, respectively. The development of the spectral notch cues to source location, the spatial- and frequency-dependent distributions of DTF amplitude gain (acoustic directionality), maximum gain, and the acoustic axis, and the resonance frequency and associated gain of the ear canal and concha were systematically related to the dimensions of the head and pinnae. These monaural acoustical properties of the head and pinnae in the cat are mature by 16 weeks."

Baseline ecological information necessary for population management is lacking. We radiocollared free-roaming cats (feral, n=30; semi-feral, n = 14; owned, n = 10) in Caldwell, Texas, USA between October 2004 and November 2005 and compared population demographics among sex and ownership classification. We found ranges and movements declined across ownership classes whereas survival and fecundity increased. Our findings suggest that human interactions (e.g., feeding) may result in high, localized free-roaming cat densities, which may concentrate feral cat impacts and should be considered when evaluating population control strategies."

Out of 56 isolates from cats and various wild carnivore species, 1 isolate of Mokola virus and 5 other non-typical rabies viruses were identified. The Mokola virus isolate was diagnosed as rabies in 1993 from a cat. Genetic analysis of this isolate suggests that it falls in a distinct subgroup of the Mokola virus genotype. The 5 non-typical rabies viruses were isolated from honey badgers (Mellivora capensis), African civets (Civettictis civetta) and an unidentified mongoose (Herpestidae). These isolates are representatives of rarely-reported wildlife-associated strains of rabies, probably maintained by the slender mongoose (Galerella sanguinea). These findings indicate that both Mokola virus and the mongoose-associated variant may be more common in Zimbabwe than is apparent from routine surveillance."

The average threshold for localizing a brief noise burst was 4.5 degrees which is much more accurate than the thresholds of other hoofed mammals, such as horses, cattle and goats. The ability of pigs to localize low-frequency tones indicates that they can use the binaural phase-difference cue. However, they were unable to localize tones of 4 kHz and higher, indicating that, like other hoofed mammals, their ability to use binaural intensity cues is greatly restricted if not completely absent. An examination of the superior olivary complex of pigs revealed that in relative size, shape and cell density it is more like that of cats than that of other hoofed mammals."

    "abstract": "The first case of a natural infestation with Troglostrongylus brevior in a kitten in Greece is described here. A ∼40-day-old stray cat was referred to a private veterinary clinic with signs of respiratory distress. First stage larvae of a metastrongyloid nematode were observed in the wet mount faecal preparation. Despite an anthelmintic treatment, the respiratory signs worsened and the kitten died 2 days later. The larvae in the faeces were identified morphologically and genetically as T. brevior. The present evidence suggests a vertical or direct infestation of the kitten and a severe pathogenic role of T. brevior in young cats. This report expands the recent published cases of troglostrongylosis in domestic cats to a wider geographical distribution and opens new questions on the apparent spreading of T. brevior from wild to domestic hosts."

    "abstract": "Domestic cats with small intestinal disease may develop cobalamin deficiency because of reduced small intestinal uptake of this vitamin. This study assessed the impact of cobalamin deficiency on biochemical and clinical findings in cats with intestinal disease. Nineteen pet cats, all with severe hypocobalaminemia (< or =100 ng/L) and histories of gastrointestinal signs, were studied. Cats received cobalamin, 250 microg SC once weekly, for 4 weeks. Biochemical indices of cobalamin availability (e.g., serum methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and cysteine concentrations), serum feline trypsinlike immunoreactivity (fTLI) and serum folate concentrations, and clinical findings were recorded at the start of the study and after 4 weeks of cobalamin therapy. Serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations (median; range) decreased after cobalamin supplementation (5373.0; 708.5-29,329.0 versus 423.5; 214.0-7219.0 nmol/L, P < .0001). Serum homocysteine concentrations were not significantly altered (mean +/- SD 8.2 +/- 2.9 versus 10.3 +/- 4.5 micromol/L, P = .1198), whereas cysteine concentrations increased significantly (122.3 +/- 38.8 versus 191.5 +/- 29.4 micromol/L, P < .0001). Mean body weight increased significantly after cobalamin therapy (3.8 +/- 1.1 versus 4.1 +/- 1 kg, P < .01), and the average body weight gain was 8.2%. Significant linear relationships were observed between alterations in serum MMA and fTLI concentrations and the percentage body weight change (P < .05 for both, Pearson r2 = 0.26 and 0.245, respectively). Mean serum folate concentration decreased significantly (mean +/- SD 19 +/- 5 microg/L versus 15.4 +/- 6.2 microg/L, P < .001). Reduced vomiting and diarrhea were observed in 7 of 9 and 5 of 13 cats, respectively. These results suggest that cobalamin supplementation in cats with small intestinal disease and severe hypocobalaminemia is associated with normalization of biochemical test results and improvements in clinical findings in most affected cats."

    "abstract": "Reports of natural infections of sylvatic carnivores by adult worms of species similar to Lagochilascaris minor in the Neotropical region led to attempts to establish experimental cycles in laboratory mice and in cats. Also, larval development was seen in the skeletal muscle of an agouti (Dasyprocta leporina) infected per os with incubated eggs of the parasite obtained from a human case. In cats, adult worms develop and fertile eggs are expelled in the feces; in mice, larval stages of the parasite develop, and are encapsulate in the skeletal muscle, and in the adipose and subcutaneous connective tissue. From our observations, we conclude that the larva infective for the mouse is the early 3rd stage, while for the final host the infective form is the later 3rd stage. A single moult was seen in the mouse, giving rise to a small population of 4th stage larvae, long after the initial infection."

    "abstract": "Toxocara spp. are zoonotic helminths of domestic and wild mammals and have been implicated in serious human disease. The present study was undertaken to differentiate among various adult Toxocara spp. infecting some wild and stray mammals and to evaluate the frequency of infection by Toxocara in wild mammals that may serve as a potential source of Toxocara infection in humans. Infection by adult Toxocara canis (Warner, 1782) was found in 31 of 58 (53.4%) domestic dogs (Canis lupusfarniliaris), 20 of 41(48.8%) red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 27 of 43 (62.8%) grey wolves (Canis lupus); and 25 of 42 (59.5%) Egyptian mongooses (Herpeses ichneunton); the grey wolf and the Egyptian mongoose are new host records for Egypt. Toxocara cati (Schrank, 1788) Brumpt, 1927, was found in 27 of 46 (58.7%) wild cats (Fells sylvestris). The mean intensity and abundance of T. canis was highest in grey wolves and lowest in red foxes. The prevalence, intensity, and abundance varied with host species, sex, and season. Prevalence ofT. canis and T. cad was almost the same in both sexes in all of the examined hosts. However, intensity was significantly higher in females of red fox, gray wolf, and wild cat. Spring was the season of highest prevalence, intensity, and abundance of both T. canis and T. cati for most species examined. However, prevalence ofT. canis in the red fox was highest in winter, whereas intensity was highest in the summer and spring, and the intensity and abundance ofT. cad was highest in the autumn. Morphometric comparison between adults recovered from different hosts revealed significant variations. However, scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface features were similar, except for those recovered from grey wolves, which had inflated lips and papillae and variable cuticular ornamentation."

In behavioural experiments it was shown that C3-C4 PNs whi be mediate the command for target-reaching. We have investigated if the C2-C4 PNs which project monosynaptically to forelimb motoneurones are specifically active during target-reaching by using the technique of transneuronal uptake of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into last order neurones which appears to be activity-dependent. The nerve branches to the spino- and acromiodeltoid muscles were injected with WGA-HRP. Cats preoperatively trained, performed either target-reaching or walking movements. Transneuronally labelled neurones in C2 to C4, located ipsilaterally in laminae V-VIII and contralaterally in lamina VIII, were found in target-reaching cats but not in walking cats. The results show a functional specificity of the C2-C4 PNs and support the proposal of activity dependent tranneuronal labelling. It is suggested that this method can be used as a tool for functional identification of last order neurones activated in different movements. ?? 1986."

    "abstract": "Stimulation-induced changes in transverse relaxation rates can provide important insight into underlying physiological changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. It is often assumed that BOLD fractional signal change (DeltaS/S) is linearly dependent on echo time (TE). This relationship was evaluated at 9.4 T during visual stimulation in cats with gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo (SE) echo-planar imaging (EPI). The TE dependence of GE DeltaS/S is close to linear in both the parenchyma and large vessel area at the cortical surface for TEs of 6-20 ms. However, this dependence is nonlinear for SE studies in the TE range of 16-70 ms unless a diffusion-weighting of b = 200 s/mm(2) is applied. This behavior is not caused by inflow effects, T(2)* decay during data acquisition in SE-EPI, or extravascular spin density changes. Our results are explained by a two-compartment model in which the extravascular contribution to DeltaS/S vs. TE is linear, while the intravascular contribution can be nonlinear depending on the magnetic field strength and TE. At 9.4 T, the large-vessel IV signal can be minimized by using long TE and/or moderate diffusion weighting. Thus, stimulation-induced relaxation rate changes should be carefully determined, and their physiological meanings should be interpreted with caution."

    "abstract": "A cross-sectional telephone survey of randomly selected households examined the extent and types of problems associated with free-roaming dogs and cats in the Teramo province of Italy. The households were sampled randomly within each municipality; municipalities were combined into coastal, central hills and mountain regions for analysis. The survey was conducted in May and June of 2004 with a response rate of 74% (397/536). Ninety percent of respondents (N=356) believed that free-roaming dogs and cats were a problem. They were most commonly concerned about personal safety, followed by animal welfare, public health and environmental sanitation. Sixty-nine percent of respondents (274) actually saw free-roaming dogs or cats where they live. While dogs were most commonly seen, cats were seen in greater numbers. Overall, 10% (39/297) and 5% (21/397) of respondents cared for free-roaming cats and dogs, respectively. Two-thirds of the respondents (251/397) believed that animals were abandoned because the owners lost interest. About 2/3 of respondents (251/397) reported that the community government should have the responsibility for dealing with free-roaming dogs and cats. The respondents supported the idea of building more shelters and controlling the birth rate as control measures rather than euthanizing dogs and cats. The results suggest that free-roaming dogs and cats are a very common sight in this part of Italy with substantial concerns by the residents. However, concerns about the animals' welfare were clearly raised, supporting the laws that make it illegal to euthanize a healthy dog or cat in Italy. Using the information from this study, research on the underlying causes of abandonment of dogs and cats or failing to sterilize them should be undertaken to begin to address this problem. Further, national and regional funding must be provided to support existing laws which should help protect and eventually decrease the numbers of free-roaming and homeless dogs and cats."

    "abstract": "Aelurostrongylus abstrusus affects the respiratory system of domestic cats worldwide, causing different clinical signs. Recently, Troglostrongylus brevior, a parasite found only in feral and wild animals until 2010, has been regarded as a cause of potentially severe bronchopneumonia in domestic cats. The life cycle of both nematodes involves the same intermediate (i.e. land mollusks) and paratenic hosts (i.e. lizards, birds and small mammals). Biological and epidemiological drivers may cause the spreading of A. abstrusus along with a possible emergence of T. brevior from marginal areas and limited hosts. Given the merit in increasing knowledge on these potentially emerging nematodes, the present paper describes clinical features and the first post mortem gross and histopathological observations in a case of mixed infection by A. abstrusus and T. brevior in a kitten. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V."

    "abstract": "Discharges of muscle spindle afferents from the soleus muscle were studied in kittens aged 1-21 days and in adult cats. Vibration applied longitudinally to the tendon elicited one impulse for each cycle of vibration over the range 1-200 Hz for the kittens and up to 450 Hz for the adult. Threshold amplitudes were generally higher in the kitten than in the adult. In response to large ramp and hold stretches applied at long muscle lengths kitten spindles showed rate saturation during the length change. Dynamic index, that is the peak rate during the length change minus the rate at the final length became progressively smaller at longer muscle lengths. No sign of saturation was seen at comparable muscle lengths in the adult. It is suggested that in the newborn the bag1 intrafusal fibre is not functional and that the dynamic response is produced only by the afferent terminals on the bag2 fibre. Another difference between kitten and adult was the length sensitivity measured under dynamic conditions. This increased much more steeply with stretch rate in the kitten. One possible explanation for the higher dynamic length sensitivity is a lack of elastic fibres surrounding intrafusal fibres of immature spindles."

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To determine if electrocardiogram (ECG) changes induced by hyperkalemia in clinical patients correspond with previously reported changes in experimental animals. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: Two private practice 24-hour emergency and critical care facilities. Animals: Fifteen dogs and 22 cats with serum potassium levels >5.5 mEq/L. Interventions: None. Measurements: The following data were collected when hyperkalemia was documented: ECG (n=37), sodium and chloride (mEq/L) (n=35), total magnesium (mg/dL) (n=18), total calcium (mg/dL) (n=30), and venous pH (n=18). Animals were divided into five groups based on severity of hyperkalemia and ECG interpretation included rate, rhythm and P-QRS-T evaluation. Main Results: Twenty-two of 37 (59%) of the ECGs were normal or revealed abnormalities that have not been previously described in conjunction with hyperkalemia. In dogs, there was no correlation (r=0) between potassium blood levels and heart rate (n=15). There was weak correlation (r=0.40; P=0.06) between potassium blood levels and heart rate in cats (n=22). The correlation was stronger (r=0.64; P<0.05) when data were compared in cats with serum potassium level >8.5 mEq/L (Groups 4 and Group 5; n=11). Conclusions: ECGs obtained from ill dogs and cats with hyperkalemia are inconsistent with ECGs from experimentally induced hyperkalemia. It is difficult to determine the clinical relevance of heart rate differences between cats with serum potassium levels >8.5 mEq/L and animals with experimentally induced hyperkalemia; this may be due to the presence of other biochemical abnormalities in diseased animals."

    "abstract": "A total of 128 feral domestic cats (Felis catus) were collected from two different habitat types in Victoria. The stomachs of 80 of these cats contained food. Mammals, chiefly rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), small murids, and phalangers, comprised some 88 percent, by volume, of the total dietary intake. Birds, cold-blooded vertebrates, and invertebrates were of secondary importance in the diet, accounting for only 5.2 percent, by volume, of the total intake. Grass and small twigs occurred frequently in the stomachs, but the volume represented was small (1.4 percent). Other items, mainly carrion and cat fur, accounted for 5.4 percent of the intake on a volume basis. Feral cats from undeveloped bush areas relied heavily on small indigenous mammals, whereas rabbits and house mice (Mus musculus) were the main mammalian prey species eaten in improved and semi-improved agricultural areas. Remains of indigenous mammals were not found in the stomachs of cats from the latter areas. It appears that feral cats are ..."

    "abstract": "Cortical neurons display two fundamental nonlinear response characteristics: contrast-set gain control (also termed contrast normalization) and response expansion (also termed half-squaring). These nonlinearities could play an important role in forming and maintaining stimulus selectivity during natural viewing, but only if they operate well within the time frame of a single fixation. To analyze the temporal dynamics of these nonlinearities, we measured the responses of individual neurons, recorded from the primary visual cortex of monkeys and cats, as a function of the contrast of transient stationary gratings that were presented for a brief interval (200 ms). We then examined 1) the temporal response profile (i.e., the post stimulus time histogram) as a function of contrast and 2) the contrast response function throughout the course of the temporal response. We found that the shape and complexity of the temporal response profile varies considerably from cell to cell. However, within a given cell, the shape remains relatively invariant as a function of contrast and appears to be simply scaled and shifted. Stated quantitatively, approximately 95% of the variation in the temporal responses as a function of contrast could be accounted for by scaling and shifting the average poststimulus time histogram. Equivalently, we found that the overall shape of the contrast response function (measured every 2 ms) remains relatively invariant from the onset through the entire temporal response. Further, the contrast-set gain control and the response expansion are fully expressed within the first 10 ms after the onset of the response. Stated quantitatively, the same, scaled Naka-Rushton equation (with the same half-saturation contrast and expansive response exponent) provides a good fit to the contrast response function from the first 10 ms through the last 10 ms of the temporal response. Based upon these measurements, it appears as though the two nonlinear properties, contrast-set gain control and response expansion, are present in full strength, virtually instantaneously, at the onset of the response. This observation suggests that response expansion and contrast-set gain control can influence the performance of visual cortex neurons very early in a single fixation, based on the contrast within that fixation. In the DISCUSSION, we consider the implications of the results within the context of 1) slower types of contrast gain control, 2) discrimination performance, 3) drifting steady-state measurements, 4) functional models that incorporate response expansion and contrast normalization, and 5) structural models of the biochemical and biophysical neural mechanisms."

In addition, using real-time RT-PCR, expression of muscle and adipose tissue uncoupling proteins (UCP2 and UCP3), deiodinase 1 and 2 (D1; D2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and gamma and peroxisome-proliferator-activator receptor-gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC1) was examined. Compared to lean cats, obese cats had increased NEFA, leptin, UCP2, and D1mRNA in muscle and UCP3mRNA levels in fat, but lower heat production, and fat PPARs and PGC1. T3 administration increased thermogenesis and NEFA in lean and obese cats, and adipose tissue PPARgamma in lean cats. It also increased muscle D1 in lean and D2 in obese cats. The increase in muscle D2 was interpreted to be reflective of the reduced serum total T4 concentration following T3 suppression of the pituitary. No effect was seen on leptin, or UCP2 and 3. This shows that T3 regulates thermogenesis but not through changes in uncoupling protein expression. It also indicates that PPARs have an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity in cats."

    "abstract": "During natural slow-wave sleep (SWS) in nonanesthetized cats, silent (down) states alternate with active (up) states; the down states are absent during rapid-eye-movement sleep and waking. Oscillations (<1 Hz) in SWS and transformation to an activated awake state were investigated with intracellular recordings in vivo and with computational models of the corticothalamic system. Occasional summation of the miniature EPSPs during the hyperpolarized (silent) phase of SWS oscillation activated the persistent sodium current and depolarized the membrane of cortical pyramidal (PY) cells sufficiently for spike generation. In the model, this triggered the active phase, which was maintained by lateral PY-PY excitation and persistent sodium current. Progressive depression of the excitatory interconnections and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current led to termination of the 20-25 Hz activity after 500-1000 msec. Including thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons in the model increased the duration of the active epochs up to 1-1.5 sec and introduced waning spindle sequences. An increase in acetylcholine activity, which is associated with activated states, was modeled by the reduction in the K+ leak current in PY and TC cells and by a decrease in intracortical PY-PY synaptic conductances. These changes eliminated the hyperpolarizing phases of network activity and transformed cortical neurons to tonic firing at 15-20 Hz. During the transition from SWS to the activated state, the input resistance of cortical neurons gradually increased and, in a fully activated state, reached the same or even higher values as during silent phases of SWS oscillations. The model describes many essential features of SWS and activated states in the thalamocortical system as well as the transition between them."

    "abstract": "1. The responses of neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of barbiturate-anesthetized cats are characterized with regard to features of their responses to short tone bursts (STBs; 25 ms). A \"decision tree\" is presented to partition AVCN units on the basis of post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) shape, first spike latency, and discharge rate and regularity calculated as functions of time during responses to STBs. The major classes of AVCN units (primary-like, primary-like-with-notch, chopper, and onset) have been described previously; in this paper, special attention is given to clarifying and systematizing boundaries between classes. Certain types of \"unusual\" units that may be confused with units in one of the major classes are also examined. 2. When STBs are presented synchronously (constant phase at onset), PSTHs of responses to very-low-frequency (less than 1.0 kHz) tones are difficult if not impossible to resolve into the classes listed above because all unit types phase-lock to low-frequency tones. However, when STBs are presented asynchronously, the responses of units with low best frequencies can be categorized on the basis of PSTH shape and first spike latency. 3. Primary-like, primary-like-with-notch, and onset units are distinguished primarily on the basis of PSTH shape. These three unit types have comparable minimum first spke latencies and synchronization to tones. One type of \"unusual\" response poses a particular hazard with respect to the generation of uncontaminated primary-like populations. Such \"unusual\" units have PSTHs that appear primary-like; these units are, however, distinguished by their unusually long first spike latencies. Unlike primary-like units, these \"unusual\" units show extremely poor synchronization to tones. 4. Chopper units are defined as having an initial response that is highly regular, resulting in the characteristic multimodal PSTH. \"Unusual\" units with multimodal PSTHs but whose initial responses are not highly regular (measured by the reproducibility of the initial firing pattern in response to multiple repetitions of a STB) are eliminated from the chopper populations. 5. In barbiturate-anesthetized cats, at least three patterns of chopper response can be distinguished on the basis of temporal patterns of rate and regularity adaptation. \"Sustained\" choppers show no adaptation of instantaneous rate (measured by the inverse of the mean interspike interval), and their discharge remains highly regular throughout the response. \"Transiently adapting\" choppers undergo a very rapid (less than 10 ms) decrease in instantaneous rate accompanied by a sharp increase in discharge irregularity."

    "abstract": "The possibility of neural injury during prolonged electrical stimulation of the brain imposes some constraints on the use of this technique for therapeutic and experimental applications. Stimulating electrodes of various sizes were used to investigate the interactions of two stimulus parameters, charge density and charge per phase, in determining the threshold of neural injury induced by electrical stimulation. Platinum electrodes ranging in size from 0.002 to 0.5 cm2 were implanted over the parietal cortex of adult cats. Penetrating microelectrodes fabricated from iridium, with surface areas of 65 +/- 3 x 10(-6) cm2 were inserted into the parietal cortex. Ten days after implantation, the electrodes were pulsed continuously for 7h using charge balanced, current regulated, symmetric pulse pairs, 400 microseconds per phase in duration, at a repetition rate of 50 Hz. The animals were perfused immediately after the stimulation for histologic evaluation of the brain tissue subjacent to the electrode sites. The results show that charge density (as measured at the surface of the stimulating electrode), and charge per phase, interact in a synergistic manner to determine the threshold of stimulation-induced neural injury. This interaction occurs over a wide range of both parameters; for charge density from at least 10 to 800 microC/cm2 and, for charge per phase, from at least 0.05 to 5.0 microC per phase. The significance of these findings in elucidating the mechanisms underlying stimulation-induced injury is discussed."

    "abstract": "Questions surrounding the biology of large fossil predators that differ markedly from living forms have long intrigued palaeobiologists. Among such taxa few have excited more interest than sabertooth cats, whose distinctive hypertrophied canines are suggestive of killing behaviors and feeding ecologies that may have departed widely from those of extant carnivores. Moreover, considerable variation among sabertooth species is further suggestive of intriguing differences within the group. Behavior and ecology in another large, extinct mammalian carnivore, the Australian marsupial lion (Thylacoleo carnifex), has also proven contentious. In this study, we assemble a wide range of cranio-dental and postcranial indices in a dataset including machairodont sabertooths, T. carnifex and an extensive sample of extant taxa in order to examine the palaeobiology of these charismatic fossil carnivores. Results of multivariate analyses point to significant relationships between behavior and overall body proportions in extant mammalian carnivores. Postcranial morphologies of two American dirk-tooth species of sabertooth (Smilodon) depart greatly from those of living felids and group most closely with bears among living placentals. Scimitar-tooth species of Homotherium and Machairodus cluster with modern pantherine cats. The marsupial lion groups with Smilodon. If these latter two phylogenetically disparate clades do represent a specialized, robust ecomorph adapted to predation on large prey, then it is a body plan that might be effectively identified on the basis of a handful of 'bear-like' postcranial features in combination with a more typically 'felid-like' carnassialization of the cheektooth row."

At the highest luminance tested (16 cd/m2), cats showed lower peak contrast sensitivity than humans and their sensitivity function was located at lower spatial frequencies. As luminance was reduced, the contrast sensitivity of both humans and cats declined while both peak sensitivity and the limit of resolution shifted toward lower frequencies. These changes were more pronounced in humans and resulted in a convergence of both contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution of the two species at the lowest luminance tested. The dissimilarities in the luminance dependence of spatial vision in cats and humans appear to be due to differences in both photoreceptor distribution and receptor-ganglion cell convergence. © 1981."

    "abstract": "This work describes the effect of total cerebellectomy on the development of kindled seizures produced by daily electrical stimulation of the temporal lobe amygdala. When the kindling was established, the cerebellectomized cats showed an increase in the afterdischarge and in the duration of generalized seizures. Henceforth, this duration increased persistently in the experimental cats, whereas it did not in the controls. Prior to the establishment of generalized seizures, no kindling behavioral stages or EEG differences were observed between experimental and control cats, despite the motor activity in the cerebellectomized cats being associated with persistent ataxia. In these animals there was also an increase in postictal EEG spikes after the establishment of generalized seizures. We conclude that total cerebellectomy induces anatomical and functional changes in the brain stem structures (mainly in the inferior olive and red nucleus) leading to a facilitation of tonic-clonic neocortical activity. ?? 1985."

    "abstract": "Chronic foreign-body responses and muscular changes were examined following the implantation of active miniature stimulators into the hind limb muscles of cats for periods of up to three months. The radio-frequency (RF)-powered stimulators were injected into muscles through a 12-gauge hypodermic needle. The tissue responses around the active stimulators were compared histologically to those provoked by passive devices, broken glass, silicone tubing, polyester suture material coated with polybutylate, and two of the internal components of the stimulator (ferrite, integrated circuit chip). Active and passive stimulators produced similar, benign foreign-body reactions that resulted in an essentially identical fibrous capsule over time. The responses were similar to those produced by the internal components and the suture material, and were more modest than those produced by the broken glass. The capsule did not appear to interfere with the functionality of active devices because thresholds measured during the post-implantation survival period did not change significantly over time. Unexpectedly, the severity of the reaction differed significantly amongst the various target muscles. Medial gastrocnemius exhibited the most severe response, whereas tibialis anterior had the least reaction."

    "abstract": "1. Upper eyelid position and velocity, and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle, were recorded bilaterally in alert cats during spontaneous, reflexively evoked, and conditioned eyelid movements. 2. Spontaneous blinks appeared randomly (0.2-0.5 per min) and consisted of a fast, large downward lid movement followed by a slower up phase. Blinks of smaller amplitude and slower velocity were also observed mainly accompanying behavioral movements, such as during peering and grimacing. 3. Eyelid response to air puffs applied to the cornea and tarsal lid skin consisted of a short-latency (9-16 ms), fast (up to 2,000 degrees/s) downward movement that lasted for 25-30 ms, followed by late, small downward sags that were sometimes still evident after stimulus offset. Blinks outlasted the duration of the stimulus by approximately 150 ms. Blinks elicited by flashes of light or tones showed longer latency (47.3 +/- 6.3 and 53.7 +/- 8.0 ms, mean +/- SD; respectively), smaller amplitude, and a quicker habituation than air-puff-evoked lid responses. 4. For the down phase of the blink, the peak velocity, but not its duration, increased linearly with blink amplitude. Because the rise time of the down phase remained constant, changes in blink amplitude seemed to be the result of increased blink velocity. The down phase of a typical 10 degrees blink was 10 times faster than the up phase of the same blink or than upward and downward lid saccades of the same amplitude. The peak velocity and duration of the up phases of reflex blinks and upward and downward lid saccades increased linearly with lid movement amplitude. 5. The initial down phase of air-puff-evoked blinks decreased in latency, increased in amplitude and peak velocity, and maintained the same rise time for increasing puff pressure. None of these parameters was dependent on puff duration. The duration of the blink also increased linearly with air puff duration. 6. The amplitude of air-puff-evoked blinks was inversely related to lid position, decreasing with further lid positions in the closing direction. In contrast, neither peak nor integrated EMG activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle was affected by lid position, being only a function of stimulus parameters and of the animal's level of alertness. 7. Air puffs > 20 ms and > 1 kg/cm2 evoked two successive bursts (R(ap) 1 and R(ap) 2) in the EMG activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Shorter and/or weaker stimuli evoked only the R(ap) 1 response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "Exposure of rodents to cats or certain cat odors results in long-term behavioral effects reminiscent of enhanced anxiety that have been considered to model post-traumatic stress disorder. However, other severe stressors such as tail-shock or immobilization in wooden boards (IMO) appear to induce shorter lasting changes in anxiety. In addition, there are controversial results regarding the effects of urine/feces odors. In the present work, we studied in two experiments the relationship between the degree of stress experienced by the animals during exposure to IMO, urine odors or fur odors (as assessed by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation and plasma glucose) and the short- and long-term behavioral consequences. In the first experiment, rats were individually exposed for 15 min to a novel environment (white large cages) containing either clean cat litter (controls) or litter soiled by cats (urine odors). Half of the rats in each condition were left to freely explore the environment whereas the others were subjected to immobilization (IMO) within the cages. Although ACTH, corticosterone and glucose responses to IMO were much stronger than those to the white cages with clean litter or urine odors (which did not differ from each other), no effect of treatments on anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) were found one week later. However, previous IMO exposure did cause sensitization of the ACTH response to the EPM. In the second experiment, the response to white large cages containing either no odor (controls), litter soiled by cats (urine odor) or a cloth impregnated with cat odor (fur odor) was compared. Urine and fur odors elicited similar ACTH and corticosterone responses that were higher than those of controls, but plasma glucose levels were slightly higher in rats exposed to fur odor. When compared to controls, activity was only diminished in the novel cages containing fur odor. Similarly, fur odor-exposed rats, but not those exposed to urine odor, showed signs of enhanced anxiety in the EPM seven days later, although the ACTH response to the EPM was similar in the three groups. The present data demonstrate: (a) a marked dissociation between the degree of ACTH, corticosterone and glucose responses to stressors and their long-term anxiety-like effects; (b) that the type of cat odor is critical in determining the short-term and long-term physiological and behavioral consequences of exposure; and (c) that plasma ACTH released during brief exposure to the EPM does not appear to reflect anxiety-like behavior."

    "abstract": "The behaviour of Homo sapiens has a pivotal role to play in the macro and microepidemiology of emerging or re-emerging parasitic zoonoses. Changing demographics and the concomitant alterations to the environment, climate, technology, land use and changes in human behavior, converge to favour the emergence and spread of parasitic zoonoses. The recent unprecedented movements of people, their animals and their parasites around the world, introduce and mix genes, cultural preferences, customs, and behavioral patterns. The increasing proclivity for eating meat, fish, crabs, shrimp, molluscs raw, undercooked, smoked, pickled or dried facilitates a number of protozoan (Toxoplasma), trematode (Fasciola sp., Paragonimus spp., Clonorchis sp., Opisthorchis spp., Heterophyes sp., Metagonimus sp., Echinostoma spp., Nanophyetus sp.) cestode (Taenia spp, Diphyllobothrum sp.) and nematode (Trichinella spp., Capillaria spp., Gnathostoma spp., Anisakis sp., Parastrongylus spp.) caused zoonoses. The increasing world population and the inability to keep pace with the provision of adequate sanitation and clean, safe drinking water, has led to an increased importance of waterborne zoonoses, such as those caused by Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma. Our close relationship with and the numerous uses to which we put companion animals and their ubiquitous distribution has resulted in dogs and cats unwitting participation in sharing over 60 parasite species including: Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, most foodborne trematode species, Diphyllobothrum, Echinococcus spp., Ancylostoma and Toxocara. Changing human behaviour through education, to encourage the proper cooking of food, which may have cultural and social significance, will remain as challenging as controlling stray and feral pet populations, improving hygiene levels and the provision of safe drinking water and the proper use of sanctuary facilities. Long pre-patent periods and the normally insidious sub-clinical nature of most zoonoses makes advice requiring behavioural change for their control a difficult task. Our clearer understanding of the heterogeneity of susceptibility to infection, the complex genetic variations of people and parasite species and the development of molecular epidemiological tools is shedding more light on transmission routes and the spectrum of disease that is observed. Improved and new serological, molecular and imaging diagnostic tests and the development of broad spectrum chemotherapeutic agents has led to the attenuation of morbidity and mortality due to parasitic zoonoses in economically advantaged regions. Such advancements, in partnership with supportive behavioural change, has the potential for a sustainable global reduction in the burden of ill health due to parasitic zoonoses. Whether this will materialise is a challenge for us all."

    "abstract": "Many animals rely on vision for navigating through complex environments and for avoiding specific obstacles during locomotion. Navigation and obstacle avoidance are tasks that depend on gathering information about the environment by vision and using this information at later times to guide limb and body movements. Here we review studies demonstrating the use of short-term visual memory during walking in humans and cats. Our own investigations have demonstrated that cats have the ability to retain a memory of an obstacle they have stepped over with the forelegs for many minutes and to use this memory to guide stepping of the hindlegs to avoid the remembered obstacle. A brain region that may be critically involved in the retention of memories of the location of obstacles is the posterior parietal cortex. Recordings from neurons in area 5 in the posterior parietal cortex in freely walking cats have revealed the existence of neurons whose activity is strongly correlated with the location of an obstacle relative to the body. How these neurons might be used to regulate motor commands remains to be established. We believe that studies on obstacle avoidance in walking cats have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of visuo-motor transformations. Current knowledge about the brain regions and pathways underlying visuo-motor transformations during walking are reviewed."

Microscopically, these epulides were nonencapsulated, well-vascularized, infiltrative, highly cellular neoplasms that expanded the gingiva and were composed of haphazardly arranged, spindle-shaped to stellate cells amid a dense, collagenous stroma. Osseous foci were a feature in the fibromatous and ossifying epulides. The mitotic rate was low and there was marked hyperplasia of the overlying gingiva with a prominent downgrowth of epithelial cords. These tumors recurred in 8 of 13 cats following surgical excision. While uncommon, multiple epulides in cats have a high incidence of recurrence but do not appear to have metastatic potential."

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epileptics often experience profound interictal (i.e. between seizure) emotional disturbances, such as fear, anxiety, and depression. Although the presence of this interictal emotionality has been well documented, little progress has been made in identifying its precise nature and cause because it is not amenable to experimental analysis in clinical populations. Accordingly, there is much to gain by studying the fundamental nature and neural basis of interictal emotionality using animal models. Kindling is a widely studied animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy in which daily electrical stimulation of certain brain regions results in the gradual progression and intensification of limbic motor seizures. Several investigators have found that partial and short-term kindling produce robust changes in emotional behavior in both cats and rats. Recently, our laboratory has developed a new model to study interictal emotionality using long-term kindling in rats. These long-term kindled rats display profound changes in fearful and defensive behavior which last for at least two months after the final stimulation. We are now beginning to use this model to study the neural mechanisms underlying the development and expression of interictal emotionality."

    "abstract": "P. ecuadoriensis in the first lung fluke described from Ecuador. The description is based on 10 adult flukes from a natural infected Coati (Nasua nasua), 23 adults from 2 experimentally infected cats, and 200 metacercariae from the second intermediate host, the freshwater crab Hypolobocera aequatorialis. The new species is characterized by the following features: mouth succer larger than acetabulum or nearly of the same size; integument spines (\"cuticular\" spines) single; ovary with 5-6 short branches, which divide into more or less short broad lobes; testes larger than ovary with 5-6 simple or polymorphic lobes; eggs longish-ovoid, shell thin and uniform in thickness; surface undulated. Metacercariae not encysted. The adults of the new species are differentiated from probably related lung flukes P. peruvianus, P. mexicanus, and P. inca by the different morphology of ovary and testes, and by the size and form of the eggs. The metacercariae of P. ecuadoriensis are located not only in the hepatopancreas of the crab host - as it is in the case of P. peruvianus - but also and more frequently in the musculature. Paragonimus-eggs from sputum of two patients show partly the same characteristics as the eggs from animal hosts. One may therefore assume that P. ecuadoriensis is infecting humans in the investigated area."

    "abstract": "Similar to other urban areas where food and shelter are abundant, the zoological garden of Rio de Janeiro has dealt for years with a colony of feral or semi-feral domestic cats. A survey was conducted during 2002-2004 as a follow-up to a previous study in 2001 of the cat colony to identify pathogens circulating among the population and to annually follow the status of the cats to analyze morbidity coefficients and associations among infections and infestations identified in the colony. During the 3 years of the present study, 75 cats were sampled at least once, including 44 that were caught and examined only once, 14 that were examined twice, and 17 that were examined three times. For each cat that was caught, records were kept regarding sex, age, general health, and the presence of ectoparasites. Each year, a blood sample was taken for hematologic testing, platelet count, hemoparasite detection, antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, and retrovirus detection. Blood counts were within normal range for the majority of cats tested. Feline immunodeficiency virus, fleas, and lice were detected in all years; however, incidence rates for each of these varied significantly throughout the years. Prevalence of Cytauxzoon spp., Mycoplasma spp., T gondii infections were variable among the 3 years, although differences were not significant. Prevalence of feline leukemia virus increased significantly over the 3 years. Mycoplasma spp. and flea infestations were significantly associated, but no other associations among the pathogens were detected. Over the 3 years, the rate of new cat introductions decreased, and the pathogens showed a tendency to disseminate throughout the colony; however, there was virtually no evidence of clinically detectable disease. Therefore, it seems that stabilizing the population by a judicious control program facilitated the distribution of the pathogens throughout the colony, while the general well-being of the cats was not seriously affected.

    "abstract": "Adult cats were adapted to hypoglucidic semi-purified diets containing casein or soya as the protein source to study the effects of a 2 hr immobilization period. Body weight of cats fed hypoglucidic diets was significantly decreased. The control casein group showed higher plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity but lower pyridoxal 5'-phosphate level than control soya group. Cats fed hypoglucidic casein diet, plasma glucose, insulin and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels were increased whereas cats fed hypoglucidic soya diet, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels were decreased and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity increased when data were compared to their respective control groups. A 2 hr immobilization period induced hyperglycemia in all groups whereas cats fed soya diets, plasma insulin level and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity were significantly increased and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate content significantly decreased. These results demonstrate that dietary casein and soya protein might be differentiated on a physiological basis and immobilization emphasized the biochemical disturbances observed between the groups thus suggesting a greater resistance to stress in casein groups than in soya groups."

    "abstract": "Diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are a common problem in cats, and the clinical signs associated with these diseases, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, or weight loss, are some of the most common presenting complaints for cats taken to veterinary clinics in the United States. There are many causes for GI disease in cats, and an equally diverse number of pharmacologic approaches for management of GI disease; however, management of any GI disease is not complete without the concurrent addition of appropriate dietary therapy. This therapy may be completely curative in some instances (eg, dietary allergy), but even in cases where diet is not the cause of the GI problem, appropriate dietary therapy is essential to the long-term management of GI disease. Whether that is a highly digestible diet to improve digestion of foods by a diseased GI tract (eg, inflammatory bowel disease or lymphoma) or a high-fiber diet to improve colonic function in cats with colitis, the role of diet in management of disorders of the GI tract cannot be ignored. This article will review the current state of understanding of the role of diet in the management of GI diseases in cats and will offer the reader an overview of diet management strategies in cats."

    "abstract": "Most neurons of the auditory pathway discharge spikes locked to the onset of an acoustic stimulus, but it is largely unknown in which way the acoustic parameters of sound onsets shape the neuronal responses. In this paper is analyzed the number of spikes discharged by single neurons in primary auditory cortex of barbiturate-anesthetized cats to the onsets of tones of characteristic frequency. The time course of the peak pressure (i.e., the envelope) was altered by parametrically varying sound pressure level (SPL), rise time, and rise function (linear or cosine-squared). For both rise functions, rise time had manifold, and in some cases dramatic, effects on conventional spike count-level functions. In general, threshold SPL, dynamic range, and the lowest SPL at which monotonic spike count functions saturated increased with prolongation of the rise time. In neurons with mostly nonmonotonic spike count-level functions, \"best SPL\" increased and the descending high-SPL arms flattened, so that functions obtained with long rise times were often monotonic whereas those obtained with shorter rise times were highly nonmonotonic. Consequently, the \"tuning\" to SPL was less sharp for longer rise time tones, and spike count versus rise time functions changed from \"short-pass\" to \"long-pass\" with an increase in SPL. Systematic effects of rise time persisted when spike counts were plotted against the rate of change of peak pressure or against the maximum acceleration of peak pressure. However, when spike counts were plotted as a function of the instantaneous peak pressure at the time of response initiation, the functions obtained with different rise times, and even with different rise functions, were in close register. This suggests that the stimulus-dependent component of first-spike latency can be viewed as an integration window, during which rate of change of peak pressure is integrated. The window commences with tone onset and its duration is inversely related to the maximum acceleration (or, for linear rise functions, the rate of change) of peak pressure and the neuron's transient sensitivity. The present findings seriously question, for onset responses, the usefulness of the spike count-level function and measures derived from it, such as threshold SPL, dynamic range, best SPL, or degree of nonmonotonicity. They further cast doubt onto the validity of current concepts of intensity coding at cortical levels, because most neurons' onset responses are not indicative of a signal's steady-state SPL. However, they suggest a mechanism by which a neuronal population will sample a given transient in an orderly, sensitivity-dependent, temporal sequence. The sampling rate is automatically adjusted to, and adjusted by, the rapidity of the signal's change. And the instantaneous properties of the transient could be represented by the ratios and spatial distribution of responses across the simultaneously active subpopulation. Such a mechanism could provide the basis for the demonstrated capability of discrimination of rapid transients."

    "abstract": "Twelve young adult (1.7 +/- 0.1 yr) male cats were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design to determine the effects of fiber type on nutrient digestibility, fermentative end products, and fecal microbial populations. Three diets containing 4% cellulose, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), or pectin were evaluated. Feces were scored based on the 5-point system: 1 being hard, dry pellets, and 5 being watery liquid that can be poured. No differences were observed (P > 0.100) in intake of DM, OM, CP, or acid-hydrolyzed fat; DM or OM digestibility; or fecal pH, DM%, output on an as-is or DM basis, or concentrations of histamine or phenylalanine. Crude protein and fat digestibility decreased (P = 0.079 and 0.001, respectively) in response to supplementation with pectin compared with cellulose. Both FOS and pectin supplementation resulted in increased fecal scores (P < 0.001) and concentrations of ammonia (P = 0.003) and 4-methyl phenol (P = 0.003). Fecal indole concentrations increased (P = 0.049) when cats were supplemented with FOS. Fecal acetate (P = 0.030), propionate (P = 0.035), and total short-chain fatty acid (P = 0.016) concentrations increased in pectin-supplemented cats. Fecal butyrate (P = 0.010), isobutyrate (P = 0.011), isovalerate (P = 0.012), valerate (P = 0.026), and total branched-chain fatty acids + valerate (P = 0.008) concentrations increased with supplementation of FOS and pectin. Fecal cadaverine (P < 0.001) and tryptamine (P < 0.001) concentrations increased with supplementation of FOS and pectin. Fecal tyramine concentrations decreased (P = 0.039) in FOS-supplemented cats, whereas spermidine concentrations increased (P < 0.001) in pectin-supplemented cats. Whereas fecal concentrations of putrescine (P < 0.001) and total biogenic amines (P < 0.001) increased with FOS and pectin, the concentrations of these compounds were increased (P < 0.001) in cats supplemented with pectin. Fecal Bifidobacterium spp. concentrations increased (P = 0.006) and Escherichia coli concentrations decreased (P < 0.001) in FOS-supplemented cats. Fecal concentrations of Clostridium perfringens (P < 0.001), E. coli (P < 0.001), and Lactobacillus spp. (P = 0.030) also increased in pectin-supplemented cats. In addition to increasing populations of protein-fermenting microbiota, pectin increased production of fermentative end products associated with carbohydrate compared with protein fermentation. Pectin and FOS may be useful fiber sources in promoting intestinal health of the cat."

    "abstract": "This paper describes 17 cats that developed an idiopathic necrosis of the femoral neck. In four cats the lesions were bilateral when they were first examined and five cats developed lesions in the other limb within five months. They were all male cats, two years old or younger, and 15 had been neutered. The initial sign was a vague lameness which typically progressed, often acutely, to a more severe lameness. Radiography demonstrated radiolucency and loss of definition within the proximal femoral metaphysis, the femoral neck. In 12 cases there was a complete radiolucent line across the femoral neck. An excision arthroplasty was carried out on all the affected hips and the lameness resolved in all cases. The clinical and radiological signs suggest a primary bone resorption with secondary fracture of the femoral neck. The lesions have some similarities with Legg-Calve-Perthes' disease, traumatic fracture of the femoral neck, canine metaphyseal osteopathy, bacterial osteomyelitis and experimental feline herpes virus osteomyelitis."

Both V1 and V2 contain maps of the orientation of subjective gratings that have their basis in specific kinds of neuronal responses to subjective orientations. A greater proportion of neurons in V2 than in V1 show a robust response to subjective edges. Through the use of subjective stimuli in which the orientation of the luminance component is invariant, an unmasked V1 response to subjective edges alone can be demonstrated. The data indicate that the processing of subjective contours begins as early as V1 and continues progressively in higher cortical areas."

This new generalized Michaelis-Menten-type equation provides a flexible model for animal growth capable of describing sigmoidal and diminishing returns behavior. The parameters of the nonlinear model are open to biological interpretation and can be used to calculate reliable estimates of growth traits, such as maximum or average postnatal growth rates. To evaluate the new model, the derived equation and standard growth functions such as the Gompertz and Richards were used to fit 83 growth data sets of different animal species (fish, mice, hamsters, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, broilers, turkeys, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle) with a large range in body size. A comparative study was carried out based on mathematical, statistical, and biological characteristics of the models. The statistical goodness-of-fit achieved with the new model was similar to that of Richards, and both were slightly superior to the Gompertz. The new model differed from the others with respect to some of the estimated growth traits, but there were highly significant correlation coefficients between estimates obtained with the different models, and the ranking of animals based on growth parameters computed with the new function agreed with the rankings computed by the other models. Therefore, the new model, with its variable inflection point, was able to adequately describe growth in a wide variety of animals, to fit a range of data showing sigmoidal growth patterns, and to provide satisfactory estimates of traits for quantifying the growth characteristics of each type of animal."

    "abstract": "In this first intracellular study of neocortical activities during waking and sleep states, we hypothesized that synaptic activities during natural states of vigilance have a decisive impact on the observed electrophysiological properties of neurons that were previously studied under anesthesia or in brain slices. We investigated the incidence of different firing patterns in neocortical neurons of awake cats, the relation between membrane potential fluctuations and firing rates, and the input resistance during all states of vigilance. In awake animals, the neurons displaying fast-spiking firing patterns were more numerous, whereas the incidence of neurons with intrinsically bursting patterns was much lower than in our previous experiments conducted on the intact-cortex or isolated cortical slabs of anesthetized cats. Although cortical neurons displayed prolonged hyperpolarizing phases during slow-wave sleep, the firing rates during the depolarizing phases of the slow sleep oscillation was as high during these epochs as during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Maximum firing rates, exceeding those of regular-spiking neurons, were reached by conventional fast-spiking neurons during both waking and sleep states, and by fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during waking. The input resistance was more stable and it increased during quiet wakefulness, compared with sleep states. As waking is associated with high synaptic activity, we explain this result by a higher release of activating neuromodulators, which produce an increase in the input resistance of cortical neurons. In view of the high firing rates in the functionally disconnected state of slow-wave sleep, we suggest that neocortical neurons are engaged in processing internally generated signals."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine apparent seroprevalence of antibodies against Sarcocystis neurona in a population of domestic cats previously tested for antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Serum from 196 domestic cats. PROCEDURE: Banked serum samples submitted to the Michigan State University Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory for T. gondii diagnostic testing were tested for antibodies against S. neurona by use of an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test and a western blot test. Submission records were analyzed to determine descriptive statistics and test for associations between positive results of a test for S. neurona and other variables in the data set. RESULTS: 10 of 196 (5%) samples yielded positive results for antibodies against S. neurona by use of western blot analysis, whereas 27 samples yielded positive results by use of the IFA. No association was found between S. neurona western blot test results and T. gondii test results, age, sex, or the reason for T. gondii testing. The S. neurona IFA titer was positively and significantly associated with positive results of western blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Domestic cats are not likely to play a substantial role as intermediate hosts in the natural life cycle of S. neurona. Results indicate that natural infection of domestic cats may occur, and small animal practitioners should be aware of this fact when evaluating cats with neurologic disease. The S. neurona IFA test had lower specificity than western blot analysis."

Movements of six cats were monitored by radio-tracking for 8-21 months. Adults maintained discrete home ranges; areas varied from 3.3 to 9.9 (mean 6.2) km2 for males and from 0.7 to 2.7 (mean 1.7) km2 for females. Rabbit warrens, hollow logs and dense thickets were favoured daytime refuges. Mean daily straight-line distances moved bet-veen daytime refuges varied from 0.06 km for a female with juveniles to 1.67 km for an adult male. Relative abundance of cats over four years showed seasonal fluctuations, with summer maxima and winter or spring minima; the calculated mean summer and winter densities were 2.4 and 0.74 cats per km2 respectively. Summer maxima were composed of adults, adolescents and juveniles; winter minima were usually composed only of adults. Mortality, presumably caused by a nutritional stress acting particularly on subadults, maintained the adult population at a relatively stable level. ?? 2016, CSIRO. All rights reserved."

    "abstract": "We explored the relative contributions of cortical and thalamic neuronal networks in the generation of electrical seizures that include spike-wave (SW) and polyspike-wave (PSW) complexes. Seizures were induced by systemic or local cortical injections of bicuculline, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) antagonist, in cats under barbiturate anesthesia. Field potentials and extracellular neuronal discharges were recorded through arrays of eight tungsten electrodes (0.4 or 1 mm apart) placed over the cortical suprasylvian gyrus and within the thalamus. 1) Systemic injections of bicuculline induced SW/PSW seizures in cortex, whereas spindle sequences continued to be present in the thalamus. 2) Cortical suprasylvian injection of bicuculline induced focal paroxysmal single spikes that developed into full-blown seizures throughout the suprasylvian cortex. The seizures were characterized by highly synchronized SW or PSW complexes at 2-4 Hz, interspersed with runs of fast (10-15 Hz) activity. The intracellular aspects of this complex pattern in different types of neocortical neurons are described in the following paper. Complete decortication abolished the seizure, leaving intact thalamic spindles. Injections of bicuculline in the cortex of athalamic cats resulted in similar components as those occurring with an intact thalamus. 3) Injection of bicuculline in the thalamus decreased the frequency of barbiturate spindles and increased the synchrony of spike bursts fired by thalamocortical and thalamic reticular cells but did not induce seizures. Decortication did not modify the effects of bicuculline injection in the thalamus. Our results indicate that the minimal substrate that is necessary for the production of seizures consisting of SW/PSW complexes and runs of fast activity is the neocortex."

One cat showed echocardiographic changes compatible with a moderator band cardiomyopathy (MBCM). Most affected cats were domestic short hairs (DSH) (57.5%). The mean (+/-SD, range) age of cats with cardiomyopathy at presentation was 6.8 (4.3, 0.5-16) years, with an equal distribution of males and females. Clinical findings, electrocardiographic changes and radiographic abnormalities were also reviewed. The median survival time for 73 cats for which follow-up data was available was 300 days. A greater survival time was observed for cats with UCM (925 days) when compared with those with HCM (492 days), RCM (132 days) or DCM (11 days)."

    "abstract": "Cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) often develop diastolic dysfunction, which can lead to development of left congestive heart failure. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography has emerged as a useful, noninvasive method for assessing diastolic function in cats. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) has been performed in cats and accurately quantifies left ventricular (LV) mass in normal cats. However, assessment of cardiac function in cats by cMRI has not been performed. Six normal Domestic Shorthair cats and 7 Maine Coon cats with moderate to severe HCM were sedated, and TDI of the lateral mitral annulus was performed. Peak early diastolic velocity (Em) was measured from 5 nonconsecutive beats. Cats were anesthetized with propofol and electrocardiogram-gated gradient echo cMRI was performed during apnea after hyperventilation. Short-axis images of the LV extending from the mitral annulus to the apex were obtained throughout the cardiac cycle. LV mass at end systole and LV volumes throughout the cardiac cycle were quantified according to Simpson's rule. To assess the possible influence of propofol on diastolic function, TDI was performed on the 7 cats with HCM while sedated and then while anesthetized with propofol. Em was significantly lower in cats with HCM than normal cats (6.7 +/- 1.3 cm/s versus 11.6 +/- 1.9 cm/s, P < .001, respectively). There was no difference in the cMRI indices of diastolic function in normal and HCM cats. Propofol did not reduce diastolic function (Em) in cats with HCM but mildly reduced systolic myocardial velocity (S) in Maine Coon cats with HCM that were anesthetized with propofol (P = .87 and P = .03, respectively)."

We have monitored growth of the cornea in cats of different ages using photokeratoscopy. Qualitatively, the corneal surface of the youngest kittens studied (20 days old) is sometimes irregular and photokeratographs are correspondingly partially distorted. In older kittens the general surface quality appears to be improved. Quantitatively, corneal curvature is very steep centrally in the youngest kittens and it flattens with age at a higher rate than in the pericentral region. In the adult cats, radii of curvature of central and pericentral areas are approximately equal so that a relatively large region of the cornea is spherical. ?? 1978."

    "abstract": "The clinical signs of 29 cats with ultrasonographic abnormalities at the ileocecocolic junction were reviewed. Twenty-eight cats had gastrointestinal signs, with acute vomiting and diarrhea being most prevalent. Eighteen of 29 cats had enlarged cecal lymph nodes. Focal hyperechoic mesenteric fat was noted in 18 of 29 cats, and mild focal fluid accumulation was seen in seven of 29 cats. Six cats had a round cecum, and eight cats had cecal content. The cecal wall was thickened in 19 cats, and the ileal wall was mildly thickened in six cats. Three cats had changes involving the ascending colon adjacent to the ileocecocolic junction. Fourteen cats had no ultrasonographic evidence of changes in the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract, and 13 of these 14 cats were symptomatic for gastrointestinal disease. Four cats with resolution of the ultrasonographic changes also had resolution of clinical signs. These results suggest that ultrasonographic abnormalities at the level of the ileocecocolic junction in cats are clinically significant and are seen in cats with acute vomiting or diarrhea. Fine-needle aspirates and biopsies of the ileocecocolic area had a low diagnostic yield. When no other gastrointestinal abnormalities are detected, we therefore recommend follow-up ultrasound examinations of these patients."

In the recent past the distribution of canine and feline heartworms and lungworms has increased in various geographical areas, including Europe. This is true especially for the metastrongyloids Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Angiostrongylus vasorum and Crenosoma vulpis, the filarioid Dirofilaria immitis and the trichuroid Eucoleus aerophilus (syn. Capillaria aerophila). The reasons of this emergence are little known but many drivers such as global warming, changes in vector epidemiology and movements in animal populations, may be taken into account. The purpose of this article is to review the knowledge of the most important heartworm and lungworm infections of dogs and cats in Europe. In particular recent advances in epidemiology, clinical and control are described and discussed."

Between July 2009 and February 2010, responses were received relating to 234 cats, and data for 204 of these were included in subsequent analyses. The responses received provided data on signalment, aetiology, quality of life, behavioural changes and pain observed in cats after partial or total amputation of a limb. Young male domestic shorthair cats were over-represented in the sample; the most common reason for amputation was a fractured bone, and the hindlimb was almost twice as likely to be amputated as the forelimb. Although 89 per cent of the cats received analgesics/anti-inflammatories after discharge, the owners of 35 per cent of the animals observed some signs of pain during recovery. Eighty-nine per cent of the cats were thought to have regained a 'normal' quality of life as defined by the owner and 94 per cent of the owners stated that they would agree with the decision to amputate the affected limb in a pet if faced with the same decision again."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risks of anaesthetic and sedation-related mortality in companion animals in the UK. (The Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Small Animal Fatalities, CEPSAF). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study with nested case-control study. ANIMAL POPULATION: All small animals anaesthetized and sedated at participating centres between June 2002 and June 2004. METHODS: Patient outcomes at 48 hours (alive, dead and killed) were recorded. Anaesthetic and sedation-related death was defined as death where surgical or pre-existing medical causes did not solely cause death. Species-specific risks of anaesthetic-related death and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Risks were also estimated in the sub-sets of dogs, cats and rabbits that were either healthy or sick (ASA 1-2 and 3-5, respectively). RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen veterinary practices participated in the study and 98 036 dogs, 79 178 cats and 8209 rabbits were anaesthetized and sedated. Overall risks of anaesthetic and sedation-related death in dogs were 0.17% (1 in 601, 95% CI 0.14-0.19%), in cats 0.24% (1 in 419, 95% CI 0.20-0.27%) and in rabbits 1.39% (1 in 72, 95% CI 1.14-1.64%) within 48 hours of the procedure. In healthy dogs, cats and rabbits, the risks were estimated to be 0.05% (1 in 1849, 95% CI 0.04-0.07%), 0.11%, (1 in 895, 95% CI 0.09-0.14%) and 0.73% (1 in 137, 95% CI 0.54-0.93%), respectively. In sick dogs, cats and rabbits, the risks were 1.33%, (1 in 75, 95% CI 1.07-1.60%), 1.40% (1 in 71, 95% CI 1.12-1.68%) and 7.37% (1 in 14, 95% CI 5.20-9.54%), respectively. Postoperative deaths accounted for 47% of deaths in dogs, 61% in cats and 64% in rabbits. Most other small animal species had higher mortality risks. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Small animal anaesthesia appears to be increasingly safe. Greater patient care in the postoperative period could reduce fatalities"

    "abstract": "1. Simultaneous recordings were made from small collections (2-7) of spontaneously active single units in the striate cortex of unanesthetized cats, by means of chronically implanted electrodes. The recorded spike trains were computer scanned for bursts and spikes, and the bursts were catalogued and studied. 2. The firing rates of the neurons ranged from 0.16 to 32 spikes/s; the mean was 8.9 spikes/s, the standard deviation 7.0 spikes/s. 3. Bursts of spikes were assigned a quantitative measure, termed Poisson surprise (S), defined as the negative logarithm of their probability in a random (Poisson) spike train. Only bursts having S > 10, corresponding to an occurrence rate of about 0.01 bursts/1,000 spikes in a random spike train, were considered to be of interest. 4. Bursts having S > 10 occurred at a rate of about 5-15 bursts/1,000 spikes, or about 1-5 bursts/min. The rate slightly increased with spike rate; averaging about 2 bursts/min for neurons having 3 spikes/s and about 4.5 bursts/min for neurons having 30 spikes/s. About 21% of the recorded units emitted significantly fewer bursts than the rest (below 1 burst/1,000 spikes). The percentage of these neurons was independent of spike rate. The spike rate during bursts was found to be about 3-6 times the average spike rate; about the same for longer as for shorter bursts. Bursts typically contained 10-50 spikes and lasted 0.5-2.0 s. 5. When the number of spikes in the successively emitted bursts was listed, it was found that in some neurons these numbers were not distributed at random but were clustered around one or more preferred values. In this sense, bursts occasionally 'recurred' a few times in a few minutes. The finding suggests that neurons are highly reliable. 6. When bursts of two or more simultaneously recorded neurons were compared, the bursts often appeared to be temporally close, especially between pairs of neurons recorded by the same electrode; but bursts seldom started and ended simultaneously on two channels. 7. Recurring bursts emitted by one neuron were occasionally accompanied by time-locked recurring bursts by other neurons."

    "abstract": "Humans and other vertebrates interact in a variety of relationships which are inadequately described by a simple divistion of these other animals into wild, feral, tame, and domstic taxa.  Discussion of the process and semantic meaning of domestication has largely taken place in the context of the adoption of settled agriculture, but is equally relevant to complex urban societies.  Certain species adopted a synanthropic relationship in the first 'villages' of the early Holocene, and co-existence with pets has a similar antiquity.  The nature of the relationship between people and their pets is complex, and scarcely amenable to archaeolocial investigation, as part of the mutual benefit has an emotional basis, or centres on the symbolic  role of certain species within different societies.  The status of Cats in medieval towns in Britain and Ireland is a case in point, with opinions varying from the exploitation of Cats for skins, through neglected feral living, to a pet status much as today.  the truth probably subsumes all three interpretations.  Rats seem to have adapted to commensalism in northern Europe more slowly than Mice, and there may be evidence that Rats were more vulnerable to changes in habitat.  Archaeology can usefully examine the community ecology of Roman and medieval towns, but any such research must move away from simple concepts of wild or domestic status.  "

We show that retinal ganglion cells and neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cats in vivo display both these aspects of firing behavior, which have previously been reported to be contradictory. We develop a simple model that treats neurons as \"leaky\" integrate-and-fire devices and show that it, too, can exhibit both behaviors. We consider the implications of our findings for the problem of neural coding."

    "abstract": "Since cats are predators of rats and mice, interest in the consequences of exposure to cat-associated odors has increased in the last decade, particularly regarding the development of putative animal models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although in the literature there are some comments on the variability of the effects depending on the individual cat used, there are no reports on this subject. In the present study, we demonstrated, using male Sprague-Dawley rats and cloths impregnated with fur/skin odors from three different cats (one ovariectomized female and two intact males), that the unconditioned endocrine (release of corticosterone) and behavioral (inhibition of activity and avoidance of the cloth area) responses to the presence of the cat odors were statistically significant and similar among the three cats. The conditioned behavioral response to a clean cloth, studied 7 days after the initial exposure to odors, was also evident with the three cats, with minor differences among them. In contrast, only the fur odor from one of the male cats clearly increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze 6 days later. These data indicate that: (i) evaluation of unconditioned and conditioned responses to cat odors does not appear to strongly predict long-lasting increases in anxiety-like behavior; and, therefore, both types of responses are partially dissociated; and (ii) differences among cats mainly affected the induction of long-lasting changes in anxiety-like behavior. The ultimate reasons for these differences are not known, but their characterization is critical for a proper understanding of putative PTSD models."

Low-dose gemcitabine was administered twice weekly (25 mg/m2) in conjunction with megavoltage radiation in 6 Gray (Gy) fractions for a total dose of 36 Gy. Responses included two complete and four partial responses, and two cats had no response to therapy. Median duration of remission was 42.5 days (range, 11 to 85 days). Median survival time was 111.5 days (range, 11 to 234 days).

    "abstract": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is notoriously difficult to differentiate from the many other diseases with similar clinical signs and at present the only conclusive diagnostic test is the histopathological examination of a biopsy. The potential value of raised levels of the acute phase reactants, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and haptoglobin in the diagnosis of the disease was investigated. The concentrations of the two proteins were determined in serum samples from healthy cats and gave reference ranges of 0.1 to 0.48 g/litre and 0.04 to 3.84 g/litre, respectively. Levels of AGP greater than 1.5 g/litre in serum, plasma or effusion samples were found to be of value in distinguishing field cases of FIP from cats with similar clinical signs and differentiated these two groups of cats more effectively than the albumin:globulin ratio. The concentration of haptoglobin was higher in cats with FIP than in the group of healthy cats, but this protein was not of value in the diagnosis of FIP. Serum samples from feline immunodeficiency virus-infected cats were also analysed for these proteins and their concentrations were significantly elevated, illustrating that raised levels of AGP and haptoglobin are not pathognomonic for FIP."

    "abstract": "Digestible energy (DE) needs for body weight maintenance (BWM) of six adult Beagles and six domestic cats were comparatively assessed by using data from thirteen 14-day and nine 21-day consecutive apparent digestibility trials, respectively. In each trial the Beagles and cats were given different commercial foods, and feces were quantitatively collected excluding the first 7 days. The relationship between mean daily body weight change (delta BW) per trial and DE intake was examined by regression analysis of data for individual animals. Pooled mean (n = 6) data from 223 Beagle and 143 cats digestibility trials were analyzed by the same method. Significant (P less than 0.05) linear regressions between delta BW and DE intake were obtained (R2 = 0.43-0.93) for all individual Beagles, five of six cats and pooled mean data for both Beagles and cats. Mean (range) daily DE needs for BWM of six individual Beagles were 70 (63-78), 140 (127-146) and 173 (156-187) kcal for data scaled to kilograms, kilograms0.75 and kilograms0.67 BW, respectively. Respective values for six individual cats were 76 (56-89), 104 (86-114) and 114 (95-122) kcal. Analysis of group mean data for Beagles and cats generated daily DE costs for BWM of 76 and 66 kcal/kg, respectively, equivalent to 148 and 95 kcal/kg0.75. Thus adult cats had significantly (P less than 0.001) lower energy costs of BWM than Beagles when scaled to metabolic BW (kilograms0.75 or kilograms0.67), but not on an absolute BW basis."

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine whether dietary carnitine supplement could protect cats from ketosis and improve carnitine and lipid metabolism in experimental feline hepatic lipidosis (FHL). Lean spayed queens received a diet containing 40 (CL group, n = 7) or 1000 (CH group, n = 4) mg/kg of L-carnitine during obesity development. Plasma fatty acid, beta-hydroxybutyrate and carnitine, and liver and muscle carnitine concentrations were measured during experimental induction of FHL and after treatment. In control cats (CL group), fasting and FHL increased the plasma concentrations of fatty acids two- to threefold (P < 0.0001) and beta-hydroxybutyrate > 10-fold (from a basal 0.22 +/- 0.03 to 1.70 +/- 0.73 after 3 wk fasting and 3.13 +/- 0.49 mmol/L during FHL). In carnitine-supplemented cats, these variables increased significantly (P < 0.0001) only during FHL (beta-hydroxybutyrate, 1.42 +/- 0.17 mmol/L). L-Carnitine supplementation significantly increased plasma, muscle and liver carnitine concentrations. Liver carnitine concentration increased dramatically from the obese state to FHL in nonsupplemented cats, but not in supplemented cats, which suggests de novo synthesis of carnitine from endogenous amino acids in control cats and reversible storage in supplemented cats. These results demonstrate the protective effect of a dietary L-carnitine supplement against fasting ketosis during obesity induction. Increasing the L-carnitine level of diets in cats with low energy requirements, such as after neutering, and a high risk of obesity could therefore be recommended."

    "abstract": "Earlier studies recording single neuronal activity with bilateral receptive fields in the primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys and cats agreed that the bilateral receptive fields were related exclusively to the body midline and that the ipsilateral information reaches the cortex via callosal connections since they are dense in the cortical region representing the midline structures of the body while practically absent in the regions representing the distal extremities. We recently found a substantial number of neurons with bilateral receptive fields on hand digits, shoulders-arms or legs-feet in the caudalmost part (areas 2 and 5) of the postcentral gyrus in awake Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata). I review these results, discuss the functional implications of this bilateral representation in the postcentral somatosensory cortex from a behavioural standpoint and give a new interpretation to the midline fusion theory."

    "abstract": "Insular breeding seabirds are likely to be particularly vulnerable to introduced mammalian predators because they often lack behavioural, morphological and life-history defenses against predation. We studied the life-history of the black- vented shearwater (Puffinus opisthomelas) on Natividad Island, Baja California Sur, Mexico, to examine its vulnerability to introduced feral cats. Using an allometric equation, we estimated that feral cats consumed 328 g of food day(-1) to satisfy their nutritional requirements. We used stable isotope analysis of cat scat to estimate that 90% of the cats' diet was composed of shearwaters. Using data from our focal species and from the closely related manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), we created a demographic model to evaluate the effects of cat population size on the annual growth rate (lambda) of the shearwater. The annual growth rate for black-vented shearwaters was estimated to be 1.006 in the absence of cat predation. With predation, we estimated that annual growth rate declined approximately 5% for every 20 cats in a population of 150,000 birds. Persistence times of bird colonies decreased both with an increase in the size of the feral cat population and with a decrease in the size of the initial bird population."

    "abstract": "Ecologic and economic factors, as well as changes in human behavior, have resulted in the emergence of new and the reemergence of existing but forgotten infectious diseases during the past 20 years. Flea-borne disease organisms (e.g., Yersinia pestis, Rickettsia typhi, R. felis, and Bartonella henselae) are widely distributed throughout the world in endemic-disease foci, where components of the enzootic cycle are present. However, flea-borne diseases could reemerge in epidemic form because of changes in vector-host ecology due to environmental and human behavior modification. The changing ecology of murine typhus in southern California and Texas over the past 30 years is a good example of urban and suburban expansion affecting infectious disease outbreaks. In these areas, the classic rat-flea-rat cycle of R. typhi has been replaced by a peridomestic animal cycle involving, e.g., free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums and their fleas. In addition to the vector-host components of the murine typhus cycle, we have uncovered a second typhuslike rickettsia, R. felis. This agent was identified from the blood of a hospitalized febrile patient and from opossums and their fleas. We reviewed the ecology of R. typhi and R. felis and present recent data relevant to the vector biology, immunology, and molecular characterization and phylogeny of flea-borne rickettsioses."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the tear film qualitatively and conjunctival goblet cell numbers in cats with and without corneal sequestra. ANIMALS STUDIED AND PROCEDURES: This was a prospective evaluation of 11 cats with corneal sequestra and 14 control eyes that were either the contralateral normal eye when the sequestrum was unilateral or from control cats of similar age with no ocular disease. All cats in this study were examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist. The ophthalmic examinations included a neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, Schirmer tear tests, fluorescein staining, tear film break-up times, applanation tonometry, biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy. The palpebral conjunctiva at the dorsal nasal, ventral nasal, dorsal temporal and ventral temporal fornices were biopsied after topical anesthetic was applied to the cornea and conjunctiva. The conjunctival biopsies were fixed in formalin and sectioned routinely and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and periodic acid-Schiff. These slides were examined by light microscopy by a blinded examiner. Goblet cell numbers were compared to conjunctival basal epithelial cell numbers by region. The goblet cell numbers by region from the eyes with sequestra was statistically compared to those from eyes without sequestra, with a student's paired t-test. Conjunctival swabs were collected from the cats with corneal sequestra and submitted for polymerase chain reaction for Herpes felis, Chlamydia psiitticia, and Mycoplasma felis. The corneal sequestra were removed by surgical keratectomy and fixed and stained routinely, and examined by light microscopy. RESULTS: No neurologic abnormalities were detected in any of the cats. The Schirmer tear tests (eyes with sequestra 14+/-5.1 mm/min; normal eyes 15+/-6.8 mm/min) and intraocular pressures (eyes with sequestra 21+/-6.6; normal eyes 22+/-5.8) were within normal reference ranges for cats. Biomicroscopic examinations revealed varied sizes and depths of brown- and amber-colored corneal sequestra. No abnormalities were noted on indirect ophthalmoscopic examinations. The tear film break-up time was 21 s (+/-12) for the normal eyes (n=14) and 14 s (+/-13) in eyes with corneal sequestra (n=11). The average goblet/epithelial cell ratios by region for the normal eyes and the eyes with sequestra respectively were 0.66, 0.56 for the dorsal nasal fornix, 0.68, 0.57 for the ventral nasal fornix, 0.63, 0.48 for the temporal dorsal fornix, and 0.55, 0.49 for the temporal ventral fornix. There were no significant differences in tear film break-up times and goblet cell numbers in eyes with corneal sequestra and those without sequestra. Three conjunctival swabs from two of 11 cats with sequestra were positive with PCR for Herpes felis virus. These included one cat with bilateral sequestra and one cat with unilateral corneal sequestrum. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of feline corneal sequestra does not appear to be linked primarily to abnormal goblet cell numbers, qualitative tear film abnormalities, and accelerated tear film break-up time."

    "abstract": "During the last decade reports of influenza A virus infections in dogs and cats draw considerable attention to veterinary practitioners and scientists in the fields of virology and epidemiology. Earlier experimental studies showed that dogs and cats are susceptible to influenza A virus infection, but animals did not develop clinical signs. In recent years transmission of influenza virus of subtype H3N8 from horses to dogs, however, was accompanied by severe clinical signs and the infection was shown to be transmitted to other pet dog populations in the US. In Asia respiratory disease caused by influenza virus H3N2 was documented in dogs and also a fatal infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 was reported. Transmission of HPAIV H5N1 from infected poultry or wild birds to large felids and domestic cats has been reported from eight countries in Asia and Europe which caused considerable problems and concerns for both veterinary and public health in recent years. Experimentally the infection could also be transmitted from diseased to naive cats. Due to the heterogeneity of influenza viruses in their natural reservoirs of water fowl and the recent clinical natural infections in carnivores with influenza viruses of the subtypes H3 and H5, influenza virus infections should also be considered in dogs and cats with lower respiratory disease. The transmission of influenza A virus to carnivores from different mammalian and avian species may allow viral adaptation and therefore the epidemiological role of infected dogs and cats needs close attention. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Interest in collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL), health status reports, and patient satisfaction is on the rise and practical aspects of collecting PROs in clinical practice are becoming more important. The purpose of this paper is to draw the attention to a number of issues relevant for a successful integration of PRO measures into the daily work flow of busy clinical settings. METHODS: The paper summarizes the results from a breakout session held at an ISOQOL special topic conference for PRO measures in clinical practice in 2007. RESULTS: Different methodologies of collecting PROs are discussed, and the support needed for each methodology is highlighted. The discussion is illustrated by practical real-life examples from early adaptors who administered paper-pencil, or electronic PRO assessments (ePRO) for more than a decade. The paper also reports about new experiences with more recent technological developments, such as SmartPens and Computer Adaptive Tests (CATs) in daily practice. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological and logistical issues determine the resources needed for a successful integration of PRO measures into daily work flow procedures and influence significantly the usefulness of PRO data for clinical practice."

The success of any such recommender critically relies on its ability to; (1) gather and accurately model group preferences, (2) enhance group awareness of member preferences, and (3) focus user attention on areas of the recommendation space which are likely to con- tain recommendation options that are highly relevant to the group as a whole. In this paper we describe how we manage this kind of social inter- action within a group travel recommender system through effective use of visual cues and an accurate group preference modelling methodology."

    "abstract": "Objectives-To describe the characteristics of unowned, free-roaming cats and their caretakers who participated in a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program and to determine the effect of the program on free-roaming cat colonies. Design-Prospective study. Sample Population-101 caretakers of 920 unowned, free-roaming cats in 132 colonies in north central Florida. Results-Most (85/101; 84%) caretakers were female. The median age was 45 years (range, 19 to 74 years). Most (89/101; 88%) caretakers owned pets and of those, most (67/101; 66%) owned cats. The major reasons for feeding free-roaming cats were sympathy and love of animals. Most caretakers reported that the cats they cared for were too wild to be adopted, but many also reported that they considered the cats to be like pets. The total surveyed cat population was 920 before participation in TNR and 678 after TNR. Mean colony size was 7 cats before TNR and 5.1 cats after TNR. Most cats lived on the caretaker's property. At the time of the survey, 70% (644/920) of the cats had been neutered. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The decrease in the surveyed free-roaming cat population was attributed to a reduction in births of new kittens, adoptions, deaths, and disappearances. Recognition of the human-animal bond that exists between caretakers and the feral cats they feed may facilitate the development of effective control programs for feral cat populations."

    "abstract": "Monocular deprivation in kittens does not lead to an ocular dominance shift in striate cortex if the visual stimuli do not contain contours. In the present study we sought to find out whether an ocular dominance shift is produced if the visual environment does contain contours but is devoid of motion. Six kittens were reared with one eye occluded in a visual environment that was lit only by the light of a stroboscope (2 flashes per sec). Exposure was started at 5-6 weeks of age after dark-rearing from birth and extended until 8-12 weeks of age for 8 h per day. The rest of the time was spent in total darkness. Thus, the animals were completely deprived of vision in one eye, while the other eye experienced only stationary flashing contours. Single units in area 17 of these animals were studied and compared to normally reared cats. In all six animals ocular dominance was clearly shifted towards the eye with strobe experience. The ocular dominance shift showed, however, the following interdependencies with other parameters: neurones that responded to stationary flashing test stimuli were nearly always dominated by the strobe eye; neurones that responded only to moving bars or edges remained binocular. In the normal control animals the ocular dominance distribution was similar for both groups of cells. Track analysis according to cortical lamination revealed that neurones in infragranular layers consistently showed a weaker OD shift towards the strobe eye than neurones in supragranular layers (including layer 4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "In addition to its role as an energy storage depot, adipose tissue is now recognized as a complex endocrine organ. Adipose tissue releases a variety of factors, termed adipokines, that regulate energy metabolism, cardiovascular function, reproductive status, and immune function. Some of the better-studied adipokines include leptin, adiponectin, and components of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensinogen. The function of more recently discovered adipokines such as resistin are under intense scrutiny. Abnormal production or regulation of adipokines occurs in obese individuals and is implicated in the development of a variety of associated co-morbidities including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, heart disease, and cancer in people, although evaluation in domestic species is just beginning. Adipokines are now being examined as potential biomarkers for risk assessment for development of complications related to obesity. This article summarizes the function and regulation of some better-characterized adipokines. It also reviews the current information on the characterization of adipokines in some domestic species in which rates of obesity and obesity-related disorders are increasing, such as the dog, cat, and horse."

    "abstract": "The orientation map is a hallmark of primary visual cortex in higher mammals. It is not yet known how orientation maps develop, what function they have in visual processing and why some species lack them. Here we advance the notion that quasi-periodic orientation maps are established by moiré interference of regularly spaced ON- and OFF-center retinal ganglion cell mosaics. A key prediction of the theory is that the centers of iso-orientation domains must be arranged in a hexagonal lattice on the cortical surface. Here we show that such a pattern is observed in individuals of four different species: monkeys, cats, tree shrews and ferrets. The proposed mechanism explains how orientation maps can develop without requiring precise patterns of spontaneous activity or molecular guidance. Further, it offers a possible account for the emergence of orientation tuning in single neurons despite the absence of orderly orientation maps in rodents species."

    "abstract": "The stability of the interface between neural tissue and chronically implanted microelectrodes is very important for obtaining reliable control signals for neuroprosthetic devices. Stability is also crucial for chronic microstimulation of the cerebral cortex. However, changes of the electrode-tissue interface can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. In the present study, intracortical microelectrode arrays were implanted into the pericruciate gyrus of cats and neural activities were recorded on a regular basis for several months. An algorithm based on cluster analysis and interspike interval analysis was developed to sort the extracellular action potentials into single units. We tracked these units based on their waveform and their response to somatic stimulation or stereotypical movements by the cats. Our results indicate that, after implantation, the electrode-tissue interface may change from day-to-day over the first 1-2 weeks, week-to-week for 1-2 months, and become quite stable thereafter. A stability index is proposed to quantify the stability of the electrode-tissue interface. The reasons for the pattern of changes are discussed."

    "abstract": "We investigated the possibility that distal sphincter dysfunction after chronic sacral rhizotomy in the cat might be due to altered sympathetic influences on smooth and striated muscle. Three months after rhizotomy, sympathetic influences on basal perfusion pressure in the distal sphincteric urethra were significantly decreased. A prazosin-sensitive component of basal perfusion pressure remained after section of all extrinsic urethral innervation in both control and chronic cats. Local intra-arterial 6-hydroxydopamine also abolished this component. After rhizotomy, noradrenaline content in the distal sphincteric urethra was significantly increased but there was no evidence of a change in sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation. A novel prazosin- and atropine-resistant component of the response to hypogastric nerve stimulation was seen in the rhabdosphincteric urethra of chronic cats. This component was abolished by atracurium or hexamethonium. It was significantly greater in cats with S1-3 as compared to S2-3 lesions and was never seen in control cats. It is concluded that autonomic activation of the rhabdosphincter could be a factor in distal sphincter obstruction."

    "abstract": "In order to compare the stimulation ability of insulin secretion, we determined changes in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations after intravenous administration of various amino acids and essential fatty acids in clinically healthy adult cats. Plasma glucose concentrations were within the normal ranges after injection of amino acids and fatty acids. Plasma insulin concentrations increased rapidly 2 to 4 min after injection of arginine, then decreased to the basal levels at 20 min in all five cats. Insulin peak responses were significantly greater in arginine injections than in normal saline (P<0.01). Areas under the curve (AUC) of plasma insulin concentrations from 0 to 10 min after injection of arginine were significantly larger than after injection of normal saline (P<0.01) and glucose (P<0.05). Increases in AUC of plasma insulin concentration from 0 to 60 min were observed after injection of arginine, leucine, alanine, and fat emulsion. Arginine had a strong insulinotropic effect, and leucine, alanine, and fatty acids had weak ones. Besides, valine, methionine, taurine and glutamine had no stimulant activity of insulin. Given the risk of glucose toxication and required time for testing, the intravenous arginine tolerance test may be useful for estimation of insulin responses in cats."

    "abstract": "Protected areas are extremely important for the long term viability of biodiversity in a densely populated country like India where land is a scarce resource. However, protected areas cover only 5% of the land area in India and in the case of large carnivores that range widely, human use landscapes will function as important habitats required for gene flow to occur between protected areas. In this study, we used photographic capture recapture analysis to assess the density of large carnivores in a human-dominated agricultural landscape with density .300 people/km 2 in western Maharashtra, India. We found evidence of a wide suite of wild carnivores inhabiting a cropland landscape devoid of wilderness and wild herbivore prey. Furthermore, the large carnivores; leopard (Panthera pardus) and striped hyaena (Hyaena hyaena) occurred at relatively high density of 4.861.2 (sd) adults/100 km 2 and 5.0361.3 (sd) adults/100 km 2 respectively. This situation has never been reported before where 10 large carnivores/100 km 2 are sharing space with dense human populations in a completely modified landscape. Human attacks by leopards were rare despite a potentially volatile situation considering that the leopard has been involved in serious conflict, including human deaths in adjoining areas. The results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both, humans and wildlife to each other's presence. The results also highlight the urgent need to shift from a PA centric to a landscape level conservation approach, where issues are more complex, and the potential for conflict is also very high. It also highlights the need for a serious rethink of conservation policy, law and practice where the current management focus is restricted to wildlife inside Protected Areas."

    "abstract": "The effect of capsaicin (10-80 mg/kg sc) on reflex activity of the urinary bladder was examined in anesthetized normal as well as anesthetized and awake chronic spinal cord-injured (SCI) cats. In normal cats, capsaicin elicited a transient increase in the frequency of isovolumetric bladder contractions and reduced the volume threshold for inducing micturition, but did not depress the amplitude of bladder contractions or the reflex firing on bladder nerves. In anesthetized SCI cats, capsaicin depressed reflex bladder activity and firing on bladder nerves. In awake SCI cats, capsaicin initially decreased the volume threshold for inducing micturition; however, after a delay of 3-6 h the volume threshold increased and intravesical voiding pressure decreased. This effect persisted for 4-12 days. It is concluded that capsaicin-sensitive C fiber bladder afferents are not involved in initiating reflex micturition in normal cats, but play an essential role in triggering automatic micturition in chronic SCI cats. The results are consistent with the clinical data indicating that C fiber bladder afferents contribute to bladder hyperactivity and incontinence in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction."

Cats can be severely affected and die from the disease, but subclinical infections have also been reported. To learn more about the role of cats in the spread of the virus and about the risk posed to cats, the prevalence of H5N1 virus was examined in 171 cats from areas in Germany and Austria in which birds infected with HPAIV H5N1 had been found. Pharyngeal swabs were examined for H5N1 virus using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and serum samples were tested for antibodies to influenza virus. None of the cats showed evidence of infection with H5N1 virus. Prevalence of H5N1 virus was determined to be <1.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.000000-0.017366); prevalence of antibodies was <2.6% (95% CI: 0.000000-0.025068). © 2008 ESFM and AAFP."

Although OA cannot be cured, long-term management of the disease can be very rewarding for the veterinary medical team as well as pet owners. Managing pain with pain medications is an essential first step. There are a wealth of pain medications available, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, gabapentin, amantadine, and tramadol. There are also physical modalities available for pain reduction. Weight management and nutritional joint support are also important in aspects of managing OA in dogs and cats. Finally, physical rehabilitation is a great way to improve mobility and keep pets active as they age."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the effect of dietary protein content on renal parameters in 23 healthy spayed female cats. The objective was to determine if cats eating diets high in protein will have higher serum urea nitrogen (UN) and creatinine values without a detectable change in kidney function, as assessed by urinalysis. A single random cross-over design was used. Cats were fed a standard maintenance diet for at least 1 month prior to the dietary trial. They were fed in two phases. For the first phase, cats were randomly assigned to receive either a high protein [HP=46% metabolizable energy (ME)] or low protein (LP=26% ME) diet. For the second phase, cats were fed whichever diet they were not fed during the phase I period. Blood and urine samples were collected at 2-week intervals for the duration of the study (10 weeks). UN, albumin, alanine aminotransferase and urine specific gravity were significantly higher, and creatinine and phosphorus were significantly lower (P<0.05) when cats were fed the HP diet as compared to when they were fed the LP diet, although none of the mean values were found to be outside of the corresponding reference interval. Dietary intake can result in clinically significant changes in UN and statistically significantly changes in several other biochemical analytes, although all analytes are likely to remain within normal reference intervals. Therefore, an accurate dietary history is necessary to help determine if renal parameters are being influenced by diet in a particular patient."

    "abstract": "Conservation of the order in which events occur in developing mammalian brains permits use of regression theory to model the timing of neural development. Following a small adjustment to account for a systematic variability in primate cortical and limbic systems, the model is used to generate a 95-event/nine-species matrix that predicts aspects of neurogenesis and axonal outgrowth in the brains of developing mice, hamsters, rats, spiny mice, rabbits, ferrets, cats, monkeys, and humans. Although data are compiled from species in which the timing of birth and the rate of maturation vary widely, the model proves statistically accurate, with practical implications for improving estimation of milestones of neural development, particularly for humans. Using the three-factor model (species, neural events, and primate adjustments), we produce predictions for the timing of 493 neural occurrences in developing mammalian brains that either have not yet been, or cannot be, empirically derived. We also relate the timing of neural events across the nine species in the form of a reference table calibrated to the development of laboratory rats. This 'translation' table will assist in attempts to equate the neurodevelopmental literature across species with either large or small differences in gestation and maturation, and also permit studies done in a variety of mammals to be applied to better understand human development. The comparative data indicate that humans, although conventionally considered an altricial species, are neurally advanced at birth relative to the other species studied."

    "abstract": "Free-roaming domestic cats in urban areas often live in defined social groups, and the breeding females in these groups tend to form structures of a matrilineal nature. In recent years, resulting from the growing populations of free-roaming cats in many cities worldwide, these cats are being managed using the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) method. The aims of this study were to explore the hypotheses that (a) neutering reduces aggression in the females living in such social groups; and (b) if such reduction does occur, that it might be accompanied by a reduction in cortisol levels. The study was conducted on eight cat feeding groups in residential neighbourhoods in Tel Aviv, Israel. The municipal veterinary department offers TNR services upon request. Cats are collected from the feeding group and returned to their original group after neutering. We found that neutered females showed reduced aggressiveness as well as reduced cortisol levels compared to the intact females. In addition, those intact females that displayed more aggression had higher cortisol levels compared to the less aggressive intact females. Based on the results of this study it is possible to suggest for the first time a possible relationship between cortisol levels and aggression in free-roaming female domestic cats. This study is an initial step in assessing the long-term effects of Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) on the welfare of the individual cat. If cortisol levels in female cats are reduced after neutering, partly as a result of reduced social and reproductive pressures (as expressed by lower aggression of the neutered females), it is possible that TNR has an added beneficial role in cat welfare in addition to that of control of population size."

    "abstract": "Low-grade alimentary lymphoma (LGAL) was diagnosed by histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of full-thickness biopsies from multiple regions of the gastrointestinal tract collected during exploratory laparotomy in 17 cats. The most common clinical signs were weight loss (n=17) and vomiting and/or diarrhoea (n=15). Clinical signs were chronic in 11 cases. Abdominal palpation was abnormal in 12 cats, including diffuse intestinal thickening (n=8), an abdominal mass due to mesenteric lymph node enlargement (n=5) and a focal mural intestinal mass (n=1). The most common ultrasonographic finding was normal or increased intestinal wall thickness with preservation of layering. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirates of mesenteric lymph nodes (n=9) were incorrectly identified as benign lymphoid hyperplasia in eight cats, in which the histological diagnosis from biopsies was lymphoma. There was neoplastic infiltration of more than one anatomic region of the gastrointestinal tract in 16/17 cats. The jejunum (15/15 cats) and ileum (13/14 cats), followed by the duodenum (10/12 cats), were the most frequently affected sites. Twelve cats were treated with oral prednisolone and high-dose pulse chlorambucil, two with a modified Madison-Wisconsin multiagent protocol and three with a combination of both protocols. Thirteen of the 17 cats (76%) had complete clinical remission with a median remission time of 18.9 months. Cats that achieved complete remission had significantly longer median survival times (19.3 months) than cats that did not achieve complete remission (n=4) (4.1 months; P=0.019). The prognosis for cats with LGAL treated with oral prednisolone in combination with high-dose pulse chlorambucil is good to excellent."

    "abstract": "PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Although seizures occur less commonly in cats compared with dogs, they are one of the most common forms of neurological disease in the feline patient. Cats may experience both focal (partial) and generalized seizures and causes are divided into primary disorders, in which there is no underlying cause (ie, idiopathic epilepsy), and secondary disorders. Cats with secondary seizure disorders have either an underlying structural lesion or metabolic disease. PATIENT GROUP: Seizures affect cats of all ages. Cats with idiopathic epilepsy tend to be younger (approximately 3.5 years) than cats with secondary seizure disorders (approximately 8 years). AUDIENCE: This review of feline seizures is directed at all veterinarians who treat cats, both in an emergency setting as well as in general practice. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Refractory seizures are often a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. A systematic approach to the seizuring cat is described, easing the task of diagnosing the cause of the seizures. In addition, novel antiepileptics are discussed, which can be used as add-on drugs in challenging feline seizure cases. EVIDENCE BASE: Compared with the canine counterpart, the literature regarding treatment of feline seizures is less established. Recent clinical trials and studies are focusing on new treatment options for feline seizures. Specifically, these studies, some of which are ongoing, have led to the use of levetiracetam, zonisamide and pregabalin as add-on antiepileptics in cases that are refractory to phenobarbital."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the lipid classes in hepatic and adipose tissues from cats with idiopathic hepatic lipidosis (IHL). Concentrations of triglyceride, phospholipid phosphorus, and free and total cholesterol were determined in lipid extracts of liver homogenates from 5 cats with IHL and 5 healthy control cats. Total fatty acid composition of liver and adipose tissue was also compared. Triglyceride accounted for 34% of liver by weight in cats with IHL (338 +/- 38 mg/g wet liver) versus 1% in control cats (9.9 +/- 1.0 mg/g wet liver, P < .001). The mass of cholesterol ester was significantly higher in triglyceride-free (TG-free) liver from cats with IHL (741 +/- 340 micrograms/g TG-free wet liver) compared to healthy cats (31 +/- 11 micrograms/g TG-free wet liver, P < .05). Total fatty acid composition of hepatic tissue in the 2 groups differed; palmitate was higher (19.5 +/- 1.1% of total fatty acids in cats with IHL versus 9.2 +/- 2.7% in controls, P < .05), stearate was lower (8.5 +/- 0.8% versus 16.8 +/- 1.1%, P < .05), oleate was higher (41.2 +/- 1.6% versus 31.1 +/- 1.8%, P < .05), and arachidonate was lower (1.2 +/- 0.2% versus 6.0 +/- 0.9%, P < .05). The total fatty acid composition of adipose tissue also differed between the 2 groups; palmitate was higher (26.2 +/- 1.2% in cats with IHL versus 21.3 +/- 0.6% in controls, P < .05), total monounsaturated fatty acids were higher (48.4 +/- 1.0% versus 45.0 +/- 0.8%, P < .05), linolenate was lower (13.3 +/- 1.6% versus 17.5 +/- 0.9%, P < .05), total (n-6) fatty acids were lower (13.8 +/- 1.38% versus 18.4 +/- 0.83%, P < .05), linolenate was lower (0.2 +/- 0.04% versus 0.7 +/- 0.06%, P < .06), and total (n-3) fatty acids were lower (0.3 +/- 0.02% versus 1.3 +/- 0.32%, P < .05). The fatty acid composition of both liver and adipose tissue was similar for stearate, oleate, linoleate, and linolenate in cats with IHL. These results support the hypothesis that the origin of hepatic triglyceride in cats with IHL is the mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue."

    "abstract": "Although orientation columns are less than a millimeter in width, recent neuroimaging studies indicate that viewed orientations can be decoded from cortical activity patterns sampled at relatively coarse resolutions of several millimeters. One proposal is that these differential signals arise from random spatial irregularities in the columnar map. However, direct support for this hypothesis has yet to be obtained. Here, we used high-field, high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis to determine the spatial scales at which orientation-selective information can be found in the primary visual cortex (V1) of cats and humans. We applied a multiscale pattern analysis approach in which fine- and coarse-scale signals were first removed by ideal spatial lowpass and highpass filters, and the residual activity patterns then analyzed by linear classifiers. Cat visual cortex, imaged at 0.3125 mm resolution, showed a strong orientation signal at the scale of individual columns. Nonetheless, reliable orientation bias could still be found at spatial scales of several millimeters. In the human visual cortex, imaged at 1 mm resolution, a majority of orientation information was found on scales of millimeters, with small contributions from global spatial biases exceeding approximately 1 cm. Our high-resolution imaging results demonstrate a reliable millimeters-scale orientation signal, likely emerging from irregular spatial arrangements of orientation columns and their supporting vasculature. fMRI pattern analysis methods are thus likely to be sensitive to signals originating from other irregular columnar structures elsewhere in the brain."

    "abstract": "There was nothing Molly enjoyed more than a day at the zoo with her mother. Immediately after entering the gates, she would run to the Big Cats house, dragging her mother along. Molly was just like the other Big Cat loving kids, because she relished watching the powerful animals prowl among the rocks and hearing them make those big gut-busting growls just before lunchtime. But, shortly after her third birthday, Molly 's very observant mother noticed that she was different from the other Big Cat loving kids in some ways as well. When the other kids saw the leopards, their wide-eyed facial expressions would turn quickly to their parents' faces and then back and forth between their faces and the cats. The children 's tiny index fingers would automatically extend, as if instinctually pointing to show these intriguing animals, to share the moment with their parents. Although she felt excited inside just like the other kids, Molly 's external response was very different. She did not attempt to share the experience with her mother by looking or pointing; rather, she stared intently at the animals and sometimes tapped two of her fingers together or made a clicking noise with her mouth. Molly 's mother observed that she seemed like she was in her own world during these times, as if her wheels were turning constantly. Her mother soon learned at least part of why those wheels were turning. One day Molly approached the exhibit and was able to accurately label the species name and country of origin of each cat, from memory! At 3 years of age, she had developed quite an extensive knowledge within this area of interest that seemed somewhat precocious. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York."

Vehicle solution (phosphate buffer solution) for control study and kainic acid (1, 4 and 12 μg) were administered via a chronically implanted cannula. The control group showed no modification during the observation period. After the injection of 1 μg of kainic acid, focal status epilepticus was observed for 2-3 days and then cats became normal afterwards. In the group of 4μg kainic acid injection, cats demonstrated limbic status for 3 days, and persistent inter-ictal discharges continued during the observation period. Independent amygdaloid seizures and secondary generalized convulsions developed in the cats administered 12 μg of kainic acid. The cats died in the status epilepticus. The dose-dependent and substantial effect of KA without the influences of anesthesia and surgery was demonstrated. The results were discussed in relation to the human medial temporal sclerosis and the effects on the emotional mechanism of the limbic system. We suggest this model to be useful in the study of various types of temporal lobe epilepsy and the emotional mechanisms of the limbic system. © 1982."

    "abstract": "Doses of dobutamine (steady-state infusions) required to increase inotropy (as measured by isovolumic indices of contractility) were lower than those required to produce tachycardia in the anaesthetized cat. When compared to isoprenaline, dobutamine produced less tachycardia for common increases in inotropy and thus demonstrated inotropic selectivity in this model. Dobutamine also produced mild pressor effects which were potentiated by ??-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. In efforts to define the role of the partial agonist activity of dobutamine for ??-adrenoceptors in the production of selective inotropy the effects of dobutamine infusions were observed in cats pretreated with the ??-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. In phentolamine-treated cats dobutamine did not demonstrate inotropic selectivity and showed a relationship between increased inotropy and tachycardia which was not significantly different from that obtained with isoprenaline. In contrast, phentolamine did not change the relationship between isoprenaline-induced tachycardia and increased inotropy. These data suggest that the agonist activity of dobutamine for ??-adrenoceptors could be responsible for selective inotropy in the anaesthetized cat probably by baroreceptor-mediated reflex modulation of heart rate and/or possible stimulation of inotropic cardiac ??-adrenoceptors. ?? 1985."

Behavioral enrichment issues for these groups are more similar than dissimilar, and each group can learn from the other. The emphasis on overall enhancement for laboratory dogs and cats in this review includes an emphasis on behavioral enrichment. Understanding the range of behaviors, behavioral choices, and cognitive stimulation that cats and dogs exhibit under non-laboratory conditions can increase the ability of investigators to predict which enrichments are likely to be the most successful in the laboratory. Many of the enrichment strategies described are surprisingly straightforward and inexpensive to implement."

    "abstract": "The development of stimulus selectivity in the primary sensory cortex of higher vertebrates is considered in a general mathematical framework. A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents complete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further."

    "abstract": "Cross-breeding between wild and free-ranging domestic species is one of the main conservation problems for some threatened species. The situation of wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) in Europe is a good example of this critical phenomenon. Extensive hybridization was described in Hungary and Scotland, contrasting with occasional interbreeding in Italy and Germany. First analyses in Portugal revealed a clear genetic differentiation between wild and domestic cats; however, four hybrids were detected. Here, we extended the approach to Iberian Peninsula using multivariate and Bayesian analyses of multilocus genotypes for 44 Portuguese wildcats, 31 Spanish wildcats and 109 domestic cats. Globally, wild and domestic cats were significantly differentiated (FST=0.20, p<0.001) and clustered into two discrete groups. Diverse clustering methods and assignment criteria identified an additional hybrid in Portugal, performing a total of five admixed individuals. The power of admixture analyses was assessed by simulating hybrid genotypes, which revealed that used microsatellites were able to detect 100, 91 and 85% of first-generation hybrids, second-generation genotypes and backcrosses, respectively. These findings suggest that the true proportion of admixture can be higher than the value estimated in this study and that the improvement of genetic tools for hybrids detection is crucial for wildcat conservation."

    "abstract": "Responses of large populations of auditory-nerve fibers to synthesized steady-state vowels were recorded in anesthetized cats. Driven discharge rate to vowels, normalized by dividing by saturation rate (estimated from the driven rate to CF tones 50 dB above threshold), was plotted versus fiber CF for a number of vowel levels. For the vowels /I/ and /e/, such rate profiles showed a peak in the region of the first formant and another in the region of the second and third formants, for sound levels below about 70 dB SPL. For /a/ at levels below about 40 dB SPL there are peaks in the region of the first and second formants. At higher levels these peaks disappear for all the vowels because of a combination of rate saturation and two-tone suppression. This must be qualified by saying that rate profiles plotted separately for units with spontaneous rates less than one spike per second may retain peaks at higher levels. Rate versus level functions for units with CFs above the first formant can saturate at rates less than the saturation rate to CF to-es or they can be nonmonotonic; these effects are most likely produced by the same mechanism as that involved in two-tone suppression."

    "abstract": "Objectives: To report experience with laparoscopic-assisted intestinal resection and anastomosis for treatment of discrete intestinal masses using a novel wound retraction device. Study Design: Case series. Animals: Dogs (n=2) and cats (6). Methods: Dogs and cats with discrete intestinal masses identified by ultrasonography without evidence of intestinal perforation or peritonitis, were included. A 2 portal technique was used; 1 portal was enlarged for insertion of the wound retraction device through which the intestine was examined as thoroughly as possible. The diseased portion of the intestine was exteriorized through the wound retractor and resection and anastomosis of the intestinal mass performed. Results: Of the 8 animals, laparoscopic-assisted intestinal resection and anastomosis through the wound retractor was performed in 2 dogs and 3 cats. In 3 cats, based on either location or extent of the lesion, 2 were converted to laparoscopic-assisted intestinal biopsies and 1 to an open colocolostomy. No other intra- or perioperative complications were encountered and all animals survived to discharge. Conclusions: Laparoscopic-assisted intestinal resection and anastomosis can be performed in select canine and feline patients with modestly sized, discrete intestinal masses."

    "abstract": "Cytauxzoon felis typically causes fatal disease in domestic cats. Survival after infection and persistent parasiternia without clinical illness has been documented in a few cases. To our knowledge there are no prevalence studies of C. felis in domestic cats. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of C. felis infected cats that were presented to trap-neuter-return programs in Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee. Cats that were presented to trap-neuter-retum programs were tested using a C. felis-specific PCR assay. A total of 961 domestic cats were tested (494 from Florida; 392 from North Carolina; 75 from Tennessee). Prevalence of C. felis infection in this population was 0.3%. Two cats from Florida and one cat from Tennessee tested positive for the presence of C. felis DNA. These amplicons were sequenced and confirmed to be C. felis. The cat from Tennessee was alive without evidence of illness 2 months post-surgery. The other two cats were alive 24 h post-surgery, but were then lost to follow-up. This is the first report documenting C. felis infections in free-roaming cats. Despite the low prevalence rate, the presence of apparently healthy infected free-roaming cats suggests that they may have the capacity to serve as an additional reservoir host for C. felis. Further investigations should evaluate the potential vector competence of domestic cats as well as the role of chronically infected cats in areas in which cytauxzoonosis appears hyperendemic.

In the majority of cases (46.5%) inflammatory bowel disease, ie, lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis/colitis (32.6%), eosinophilic gastroenterocolitis (11.6%) and mixed inflammatory infiltration (2.3%), was diagnosed. Furthermore, in four animals non-inflammatory mucosal band-shaped fibrosis (9.3%), and in 10 cats (23.3%) a diffuse lymphoma, was found. Six cats displayed only a gastritis (7.0%) or lymphangiectasia (7.0%), respectively. In two cats a mast cell tumour (4.7%) was diagnosed. In one cat no histopathological lesions were found. The availability of transmural biopsies from all segments of the intestine and the collection of extraintestinal samples, especially mesenteric lymph nodes, is especially helpful for diagnosing intestinal tumours such as lymphomas and tumours of mast cell origin."

When ventricular fluid osmolality was 120 mOsm, CSF volume flow ceased for both groups of cats. As ventricular fluid osmolality was increased, the CSF volume flow rate of normal cats increased to 70 microliter per minute, and in hydrocephalic cats to 40 microliter per minute. In normal cats, for ventricular fluid osmolality between 50 and 350 mOsm, Na+-influx was constant and thought to occur by diffusion; while for higher osmolalities, Na+-influx increased. In hydrocephalic cats, Na+-influx increased over the entire range of ventricular osmolality but was less than in normal cats. Acetazolamide decreased the CSF volume flow in normal cats by 40 percent, but was ineffective in hydrocephalic cats. These results suggest that CSF secretion by the choroid plexus of cats with kaolin-induced hydrocephalus is impaired.

    "abstract": "Cats have obligatory requirements for dietary nutrients that are not essential for other mammals. The present review relates these idiosyncratic nutritional requirements to activities of enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of these nutrients. The high protein requirement of cats is a consequence of the lack of regulation of the aminotransferases of dispensable N metabolism and of the urea cycle enzymes. The dietary requirements for taurine and arginine are consequences of low activities of two enzymes in the pathways of synthesis that have a negative multiplicative effect on the rate of synthesis. Cats have obligatory dietary requirements for vitamin D and niacin which are the result of high activities of enzymes that catabolise precursors of these vitamins to other compounds. The dietary requirement for pre-formed vitamin A appears to result from deletion of enzymes required for cleavage and oxidation of carotenoids. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) requirements have not been defined but low activities of desaturase enzymes indicate that cats may have a dietary need for pre-formed PUFA in addition to those needed by other animals to maintain normal plasma concentrations. The nutrient requirements of domestic cats support the thesis that their idiosyncratic requirements arose from evolutionary pressures arising from a rigorous diet of animal tissue. These pressures may have favoured energy conservation through deletion of redundant enzymes and modification of enzyme activities to result in metabolites more suited to the cat's metabolism. However, this retrospective viewpoint allows only recognition of association rather than cause and effect."

    "abstract": "Neocortical neurons maintain high firing rates across all behavioral states of vigilance but the discharge patterns vary during different types of brain oscillations, which are assumed to play an important role in information processing and memory consolidation. In the present study, we report that trains of stimuli applied to local neocortical networks of cats, at frequencies that mimic endogenous brain rhythms, produced depression or potentiation of postsynaptic potentials, which lasted for several minutes. This form of synaptic plasticity was not mediated through NMDA receptors since it persisted after blockade of these receptors, but was strongly modulated by the level of background neuronal activity. Using different preparations in vivo, we found that increased background neuronal activity decreased the probability of plastic changes but enhanced the probability of potentiation over depression. Conversely, when the level of background neuronal activity was low, plasticity was observed in all neurons, but mainly depression was induced. Our results demonstrate that high levels of neuronal activity in the cortical network promote potentiation and insure the stability of synaptic connections."

    "abstract": "Objective – To evaluate critical appraisal tools (CATs) that have been through a peer-reviewed development process with the aim of analysing well designed, documented, and researched CATs which could be used to develop a comprehensive CAT. Study design and setting – A critical review of the development of CATs was undertaken. Results – Of the 45 CATs reviewed, 26 (58%) were applicable to more than one research design, 11 (24%) to true experimental studies, and the remaining eight (18%) to individual research designs. Comprehensive explanations of how a CAT was developed and guidelines to use the CAT were available in five (11%) instances. There was no validation process reported in 12 CATs (27%) and 34 CATs (76%) had not been tested for reliability. The questions and statements that made up each CAT were coded into eight categories and 22 items such that each item was distinct from every other. Conclusions – CATs are being developed while ignoring basic research techniques, the evidence available for design, and comprehensive validation and reliability testing. The basic structure for a comprehensive CAT is suggested, which requires further study to verify its overall usefulness. Meanwhile, users of CATs should be careful about which CAT they use and how they use it."

The overall fecal prevalences of coccidia and Giardia species were 1.4% and 0.58%, respectively. Cats at increased risk of coccidia infection were under 4 years of age, intact, and seen during the summer, fall, and spring months compared to winter. Cats at increased risk of Giardia species infection were under 4 years of age. Those at decreased risk were mixed breed and seen during the summer, fall, and spring. The highest regional risk of coccidia and Giardia species infection was for cats in the East South Central region and Mountain region, respectively, compared to the South Pacific region."

    "abstract": "The sand cat (Felis margarita) is a small-sized felid occurring in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The sand cat captive-breeding program at the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife in Sharjah, UAE, has until recently been severely compromised by very high newborn mortality rates. Two different pairs of sand cats gave birth, respectively, to one and two litters (with a total of eight kittens) between 1999 and 2006. Seven out of eight kittens died between the third and 21st wk of life. Toxoplasmosis was confirmed as the cause of death in these two litters. Adult cats had high antibody titers to Toxoplasma gondii before pregnancy, suggesting that maternal immunity did not protect the kittens against infection with T. gondii and that maternal immunity might not have prevented transplacental transmission of the parasite. This observation contrasts with what is seen in domestic cats. To date, this is the first report on confirmed fatal toxoplasmosis and prevalence of T. gondii in sand cats."

    "abstract": "The felid family consists of two major subgroups, the sabretoothed and the feline cats, to which all extant species belong, and are the most anatomically derived of all carnivores for predation on large prey with a precision killing bite. There has been much controversy and uncertainty about why the skulls and mandibles of sabretoothed and feline cats evolved to become so anatomically divergent, but previous models have focused on single characters and no unifying hypothesis of evolutionary shape changes has been formulated. Here I show that the shape of the skull and mandible in derived sabrecats occupy entirely different positions within overall morphospace from feline cats, and that the evolution of skull and mandible shape has followed very different paths in the two subgroups. When normalised for body-size differences, evolution of bite forces differ markedly in the two groups, and are much lower in derived sabrecats, and they show a significant relationship with size and cranial shape, whereas no such relationship is present in feline cats. Evolution of skull and mandible shape in modern cats has been governed by the need for uniform powerful biting irrespective of body size, whereas in sabrecats, shape evolution was governed by selective pressures for efficient predation with hypertrophied upper canines at high gape angles, and bite forces were secondary and became progressively weaker during sabrecat evolution. The current study emphasises combinations of new techniques for morphological shape analysis and biomechanical studies to formulate evolutionary hypotheses for difficult groups."

    "abstract": "Despite evidence that pet cats prey on urban wildlife and may transmit disease, there is uncertainty over whether they cause declines in wildlife populations. The uncertainty fosters disagreement about whether and how pet cats should be managed, and hampers the implementation of regulations. We suggest that the precautionary principle could be used in this context. The principle mandates action to protect the environment when there is a scientifically plausible but unproven risk, and provides a rationale for immediate intervention to protect wildlife from pet cats while we await definitive studies. In applying a 4-step guide for implementing the precautionary principle, we argue that: (i) current data documenting wildlife mortality caused by pet cats satisfy the precautionary trigger of scientifically plausible risk; (ii) the risk of significant declines or local extinctions of threatened wildlife, coupled with uncertainty in establishing population declines in response to pet cats, argue for strong levels of precaution; (iii) precautionary measures that should be considered include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the maximum number of cats allowed/household, mandatory sterilisation and registration of pet cats, curfews, requiring pet cats roaming outdoors to wear collar-mounted predation-deterrents or compulsory confinement of cats to their owners’ premises; and (iv) the principle’s requirement for extensive consultation in implementing precautionary measures should encourage collaborations involving conservation biologists, veterinarians, animal welfare activists, concerned citizens and municipal officers. Adherence to these steps should assist in choosing actions that have broad support and are applicable to unique local circumstances."

    "abstract": "Free-roaming dogs or cats are domestic dogs and cats that are not confined to a yard or house. Free-roaming dogs and cats have long caused major public-health problems and animal-welfare concerns in many countries. Free-roaming dogs have been considered to be more of a problem than cats for several reasons, but the literature addressing dogs focuses primarily on their role in rabies spread and control. Free-roaming cats are becoming more of an issue in countries where free-roaming dog problems are coming under control. The change in perception of pets, beyond their value as a commodity, has also contributed to the increase in concern and attention focused on free-roaming dogs and cats. Epidemiologists have contributed much to these studies of these populations and have potential to contribute even more. The epidemiologic methods and approaches, the experience of epidemiologists in interdisciplinary teams and the importance of considering the separate sub-populations in study design and analysis all are critical in designing and evaluating interventions for free-roaming dogs and cats. In this paper, I will (1) describe a set of useful definitions regarding free-roaming dogs and cats, (2) summarize past and present topics of study in free-roaming dogs and cats, using selected examples, (3) describe the limitations of existing work and how epidemiologists might strengthen and improve this work, and (4) outline areas needing more attention by epidemiologists and why these are important."

Membrane potential was recorded from anesthetized cats while optimally oriented bars were presented, either alone or in pairs, in different parts of the cells' receptive field. In most cells, the membrane potential response to two bars presented simultaneously could not be predicted by the sum of the responses to individual bars. In many cells, however, the responses closely approximated a MAX-like model. That is, the response of the cell to two bars was similar to the larger of the two individual responses (\"soft-MAX\"). The degree of nonlinear summation varied from cell to cell and varied within single cells from one stimulus configuration to another but on average fit most closely to the MAX model. The firing response of the cells was also well predicted by the MAX-like model. The MAX-like behavior was independent of the distance between the bars (orthogonal to the preferred orientation), independent of the relative amplitude of the responses, and slightly less pronounced at low levels of contrast. This MAX-like behavior of a subset of complex cells may play an important role in invariant object recognition in clutter."

    "abstract": "The movement representation in the primary motor cortex (M1) of the cat develops between postnatal weeks 7-12. The somatosensory representation in motor cortex is present by the age that the motor map begins to develop. In this study we examined the role of neural activity in development and maintenance of the M1 movement and somatosensory representations. We blocked activity of M1 neurons unilaterally for one month by intracortical infusion of the GABA agonist muscimol during the motor map development period in kittens and in mature cats. After the drug effects were no longer present, we used microstimulation and multiunit recording in the forelimb areas of M1 to determine the motor and somatosensory representations in the infused and noninfused sides. In both kittens and adults, there was a severe reduction or elimination of sites where microstimulation evoked a motor response in the inactivated compared with the control side. In contrast, there was no difference in the percentage, topography or receptive field modality of sites receiving somatosensory inputs on the inactivated and control sides. Moreover, the pattern of somatosensory input to M1 was similar before and after inactivation. This suggests that somatosensory input to M1 is stable after the connections initially develop. Since activity blockade had the same effects on the motor representation of kittens and adult cats, M1 neuronal activity, while possibly important in map development, is equally necessary for map maintenance."

    "abstract": "Treadmill training has been shown to accelerate locomotor recovery and to improve weight bearing during treadmill walking in spinal cats. In human patients treadmill training is increasingly used in rehabilitation after incomplete spinal cord injury. In this study we examined training effects in spinal cord injured rats with an incomplete dorsal lesion. Recovery was examined with an open field locomotor score, kinematic analysis on the treadmill, and several functional tests (i.e. foot print evaluation, narrow beam crossing, grid walking, open field exploratory activity). During the course of 5 weeks after the injury, a substantial amount of recovery occurred in the treadmill trained as well as in the untrained rats. If compared to the control lesioned rats, which showed a high level of spontaneous hindlimb movements at 7-14 days post lesion, no additional beneficial effect of a 5-week daily treadmill training on the locomotor outcome could be detected in the trained group. The only change observed was a slightly larger exploratory activity of the trained rats. It is probable that the spared ventral and ventro-lateral fibers allowed spontaneous recovery and 'self-training' to occur to such an extend that systematic treadmill training did not provide additional improvement."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information on tumor control and normal tissue effects of radiotherapy to treat pituitary tumors in cats is limited. HYPOTHESIS: Radiation therapy is effective in controlling the clinical signs associated with pituitary tumors in cats, with a low incidence of adverse effects. ANIMALS: Eight cats were irradiated at Colorado State University between 1991 and 2002 for spontaneous pituitary tumors. METHODS: A retrospective review of records was made to assess tumor control and incidence of radiation-induced adverse effects. RESULTS: Pituitary carcinoma was diagnosed in 2 cats and pituitary adenoma in 6 cats. Total radiation dosage ranged from 4,500 to 5,400 cGy administered Monday through Friday in 270 or 300 cGy fractions. Acute effects were limited to epilation and mild otitis externa. Focal brain necrosis adjacent to regrowth of a pituitary carcinoma and a second tumor in the radiation field were reported as possible late effects. Median survival, regardless of cause of death of the 8 cats, was 17.4 months (range, 8.4 to 63.1 months). Median survival could not be determined if cats were censored for non-tumor-related causes of death. Six cats were alive at 1 year, and 3 cats were alive at 2 years after treatment. Tumor recurrence was seen in 1 cat with a pituitary carcinoma. Neurologic signs improved within 2 months in all 5 cats that presented with abnormal neurologic signs. Clinical signs caused by a concurrent endocrine disorder began to improve within 1-5 months in the 7 cats with hyperadrenocorticism or acromegaly. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Radiation therapy is an effective primary treatment modality for cats presenting with neurologic signs associated with a pituitary mass and can improve clinical signs associated with concurrent hyperadrenocorticism or acromegaly in cats with no neurologic abnormalities."

    "abstract": "The sonographic appearance of the feline pancreas and associated anatomic landmarks including the pancreatic duct, duodenum, duodenal papilla, portal vein, and gastric lymph node were evaluated in 20 healthy, awake cats. The pancreas appeared nearly isoechoic to surrounding mesenteric tissues, isoechoic to slightly hyperechoic to adjacent liver lobes, and hypoechoic to the spleen. The mean thickness measurements for the right pancreatic lobe, body, and left pancreatic lobe were 4.5 mm (range 2.8-5.9), 6.6 mm (range 4.7-9.5), and 5.4 mm (range 3.4-9.0), respectively. The pancreatic duct was consistently visualized in the left pancreatic lobe and had a mean thickness of 0.8 mm (range 0.5-1.3). It could be differentiated from the pancreatic vessel, by its central location, and the duct's lack of Doppler flow signal. The duodenum was used as a landmark to identify the right lobe of the pancreas. The mean duodenal wall thickness measurement was 2.8 mm (range 2.1-3.8) in sagittal section, and 3.0 mm (range 2.2-4.4) in transverse section. The duodenal papilla was identified in 4 of 20 cats. It ranged in size from 2.9 to 5.5 mm in width, and had a maximum height of 4.0 mm in transverse section. The portal vein was used as a consistent anatomic landmark for identification of the left lobe and body of the pancreas. The mean diameter of the portal vein at the level where the pancreatic body joins the left pancreatic lobe was 4.3 mm (range 2.7-5.9) when viewed in sagittal section, and 4.5 mm (range 3.6-6.1) in transverse section. The gastric lymph node was identified cranial and ventromedial to the pyloroduodenal angle in 6 of 20 cats. It had an asymmetrical shape with a larger caudal pole in five of the six cats. The largest dimensions of the gastric lymph node were 10 mm in length, and 6 mm in width for the larger caudal pole, and 5.1 mm in width for the smaller cranial pole."

    "abstract": "Many jurisdictions have adopted programs to manage feral cats by trap–neuter–return (TNR), in which cats are trapped and sterilized, then returned to the environment to be fed and cared for by volunteer caretakers. Most conservation biologists probably do not realize the extent and growth of this practice and that the goal of some leading TNR advocates is that cats ultimately be recognized and treated as “protected wildlife.” We compared the arguments put forth in support of TNR by many feral cat advocates with the scientific literature. Advocates promoting TNR often claim that feral cats harm wildlife only on islands and not on continents; fill a natural or realized niche; do not contribute to the decline of native species; and are insignificant vectors or reservoirs of disease. Advocates also frequentlymake claims about the effectiveness of TNR, including claims that colonies of feral cats are eventually eliminated by TNR and that managed colonies resist invasion by other cats. The scientific literature contradicts each of these claims. TNR of feral cats is primarily viewed and regulated as an animal welfare issue, but it should be seen as an environmental issue, and decisions to implement it should receive formal environmental assessment. Conservation scientists have a role to play by conducting additional research on the effects of feral cats on wildlife and by communicating sound scientific information about this problem to policy makers."

Nine cats, 12 rats, and 12 mice were fed T. gondii oocysts and their organs were digested in pepsin and then bioassayed for bradyzoites in mice. Of 9 cats killed 37 or 51 days after feeding 10(2) (2 cats), 10(3) (3 cats) or 10(4) (4 cats) oocysts of the VEG strain, tissue cysts were found in each cat; in the tongue of 9, in the heart of 5, in the brain of 4, and in the eyes of 1 cat. The dose had no effect on the distribution of tissue cysts in cats. Twelve rats were each fed 10(5) oocysts of the VEG strain of T. gondii and killed 21, 29, 64 or 237 days later. At each time-period, 11 tissues of 3 rats were pooled and bioassayed in mice. Tissue cysts were found in the brain, skeletal muscle, heart and kidneys of rats at each killing time; in the lungs, intestines, and mesenteric lymph nodes in 3 of 4 instances; in the tongue, liver, and eyes in 2 instances and in the spleen in 1 instance. Also, using the same procedures and sampling the same 11 tissues as used for rats, tissue cysts were seen in all organs except in the tongue and liver of 3 mice killed on day 82 after feeding the VEG strain. In 9 mice (3 with each strain) fed oocysts of the ME-49, GT-1, or P89 T. gondii strain and killed 62-130 days later, tissue cysts were found consistently only in the brain. Thus, in rats and mice, most tissue cysts were found in the brain and rarely in the tongue. This was in marked contrast to the distribution of tissue cysts in cats."

Nor were records of cats found in journals of expeditions of exploration beyond settled areas, undertaken in the period 1788–1883. Cats did not occupy Australia from the earliest point of entry (Sydney, 1788), but instead diffused and were spread from multiple coastal introductions in the period 1824–86. By 1890 nearly all of the continent had been colonised. This new chronology for the feline colonisation of Australia necessitates a re-appraisal of the early impact of the cat on native mammal and bird species. The evidence for early impacts of cats causing major and widespread declines in native fauna is considered tenuous and unconvincing."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identification of factors that predispose to bleeding into ischemic brain could lead to safer use of thrombolytic agents in the setting of ischemic stroke. Recently de Courten-Meyers and colleagues reported that occluding the middle cerebral artery of markedly hyperglycemic cats was associated with 5-fold more frequent and 25-fold more extensive hemorrhage into infarcts than in normoglycemic animals. Hemorrhage associated with hyperglycemia in cats was much more pronounced with reperfusion than with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe two patients with a unique presentation of diffuse hemorrhagic infarction of the caudate and lentiform nuclei associated with initially marked hyperglycemia and the subsequent development of hemichorea. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the marked hyperglycemia due to poor control of diabetes contributed to the hemorrhagic change of the caudate and lenticular nuclei. Because the hemorrhage in hyperglycemic cats was more pronounced in the setting of reperfusion, hemorrhagic risk associated with hyperglycemia should be investigated, particularly in ongoing thrombolytic treatment trials for acute ischemic stroke. We encourage other acute stroke investigators to prospectively look at the risk of brain hemorrhage in stroke patients with marked hyperglycemia."

    "abstract": "The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) is a group of sleep-active neurons that has been identified in the hypothalamus of rats and is thought to inhibit the major ascending monoaminergic arousal systems during sleep; lesions of the VLPO cause insomnia. Identification of the VLPO in other species has been complicated by the lack of a marker for this cell population, other than the expression of Fos during sleep. We now report that a high percentage of the sleep-active (Fos-expressing) VLPO neurons express mRNA for the inhibitory neuropeptide, galanin, in nocturnal rodents (mice and rats), diurnal rodents (degus), and cats. A homologous (i.e. galanin mRNA-containing cell group) is clearly distinguishable in the ventrolateral region of the preoptic area in diurnal and nocturnal monkeys, as well as in humans. Galanin expression may serve to identify sleep-active neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area of the mammalian brain. The VLPO appears to be a critical component of sleep circuitry across multiple species, and we hypothesize that shrinkage of the VLPO with advancing age may explain sleep deficits in elderly humans."

    "abstract": "A survey aimed at studying the presence and distribution of fleas on dogs was conducted in an area of southern Italy. Between February 2005 and 2006, dogs were examined for fleas at four private veterinary clinics, with a twice-weekly frequency. Fleas were detected on 246 (17.9%) out of the 1376 tested dogs. A total of 960 fleas were sampled and two species were identified, namely Ctenocephalides felis felis (16.3% of the tested dogs) and Ctenocephalides canis (1.5% of the tested dogs). The results of the logistic regression model showed a significant association between the flea positivity and the following independent variables: housed with other dogs or cats and utilization, i.e. increasing prevalence from pets to guard, hunting, and stray dogs. Clinical symptoms (pruritus, alopecia, and flea allergic dermatitis) were also observed in some of the flea positive dogs. Flea infestation was detected throughout the year, although the prevalence was higher during the period between June and October. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "abstract": "During the past decade, numerous studies have demonstrated stimulus-specific synchronization of neuronal activity in the gamma-frequency range. However, it appears that the different analyses are based on widely different assumptions about which frequency range to investigate. Therefore, the term \"gamma-synchronization\" refers to an inhomogeneous spectrum of definitions and corresponding frequency bands. Moreover, most studies have been performed in anesthetized animals or in awake animals by use of fixation paradigms. Thus, it is difficult to relate these results to alert animals behaving under natural conditions. Here, we investigate stimulus specific synchronization in primary visual cortex of awake cats in a tracking paradigm. We record local field potentials and multiunit activity simultaneously from multiple electrodes. (1) We demonstrate that visual stimulation induces neuronal synchronization in a broad frequency range reaching well above 100 Hz. (2) We derive a functional gamma-band based on an objective criterion: We show that synchronization of neuronal activity is optimally orientation-tuned when a broad frequency band is considered. This band starts above 40 Hz, a frequency that is typically related to the term gamma-synchronization, and extends to very high frequencies. Interestingly, the frequency of maximum synchronization is different from the frequency at which synchronization is most stimulus specific. (3) We demonstrate synchronization of neuronal activity in a distinct low-frequency band with different properties suggesting separate functional roles of low- and high-frequency synchronization."

Seroprevalance of seasonal H1N1 (41.9%) and H3N2 (25.6%) viruses was similarly high.

    "abstract": "Ctenocephalides fleas are not only the most prevalent ectoparasites of dogs and cats but also the intermediate host of the cestode Dipylidium caninum. Due to the poor sensitivity of coproscopy to diagnose cat and dog infestation by Dipylidium, few epidemiological data are available on its prevalence among pet populations. A new PCR method was developed to specifically identify D. caninum rDNA inside single fleas. The PCR test was then applied to 5529 fleas of Ctenocephalides genus, 2701 Ctenocephalides felis fleas (1969 collected on 435 cats and 732 on 178 dogs) and 2828 Ctenocephalides canis fleas collected from 396 dogs. Precisely, 4.37% of cats were infested by a flea population infected with D. caninum. Out of the 1969 C. felis from cats, 2.23% were found to be infected with Dipylidium. From the 396 dogs infested with C. canis, 9.1%% were infested with the Dipylidium infected fleas, which is significantly higher than the observation made in cats (p=0.03). Moreover, 3.1% of the C. canis fleas were found to be infected with Dipylidium, which is not significantly different than in C. felis. Looking at the number of infected fleas in the positive samples (at least one PCR positive flea in a sample), the infestation rate in samples was varied from 3 to 100% with an average of 19.7% which is in favour of easy and regular Dipylidium reinfestations of both cats and dogs in households. For the first time, the spread of D. caninum between fleas and dogs and cats is confirmed throughout Europe. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

Previous studies have utilized a demonstrator already highly trained in the problem to be mastered by the trainee. In the present experiments a variety of experimental settings were used, and 13 animals were used in rotation as observer and demonstrator. From their results the authors conclude: \"(1) On problems within their normal range of ability, cats benefit from observing the learning process of another cat. (2) Observation of fifteen skilled performances is much less beneficial than observation of the learning process. (3) The relative advantage of observation of the learning process, as compared to observation of skilled performances, is greater when more incorrect manipulations of the problem mechanism are possible.\""

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyse retrospectively a feline population with intracranial neoplastic diseases, to document seizure patterns in these animals and to determine whether partial seizures were more frequently associated with structural brain lesions then generalised seizures. In addition, a comparison was made within the population with intracranial neoplasia between two groups of cats: one with and one without seizures. Special emphasis was given to the evaluation of tumour type, localisation and size of the lesion and its correlation with seizure prevalence. Sixty-one cats with histopathological diagnosis of intracranial tumour were identified. Fourteen cats (23%; group A) had a history of seizure(s). Forty-seven cats (77%; group B) had no history of seizure(s). Generalised tonic-clonic seizures were seen in eight cats (57%) and were the most common seizure pattern in our cats with intracranial neoplasia. Clusters of seizures were observed in six cats. Status epilepticus was observed in one patient. The mean age of the cats was 7.9 years within group A (median 8.5) and 9.3 years (median 10) within group B. The cats with lymphoma within both groups were significantly younger than cats with meningioma. In both groups meningioma and lymphoma were confirmed to be the most frequent tumour type, followed by glial cell tumours. The prevalence of the seizures in patients with glial cell tumours was 26.7%, 26.3% in patients with lymphomas and 15% in cases with meningiomas. In 33 cases (54.1%) the tumours were localised in the forebrain, 15 tumours (24.6%) were in the brainstem, four (6.6%) in the cerebellum and nine tumours (14.7%) had multifocal localisation. Parietal lobe and basal ganglia mostly affected group A. In group B tumours were most frequently located in the parietal and frontal lobes as well as in the diencephalon. A positive association was documented between the localisation of a tumour in the forebrain and seizure occurrence."

    "abstract": "In early 2006, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 of the Asian lineage caused the death of wild aquatic birds in Northern Germany. In the mainly affected areas, a trans-species transmission of HPAIV H5N1 to mammals occurred between birds and domestic cats and 1 Stone Marten (Martes foina), respectively. Here, we report lesions and distribution of influenza virus antigen in 3 cats infected naturally with HPAIV H5N1 A/swan/Germany/R65/ 06. The hemagglutinin partial nucleotide sequences of the viruses were genetically closely related to a H5N1 HPAIV obtained from a dead Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) of the same area. At necropsy, within the patchy dark-red and consolidated lungs, there was granulomatous pneumonia caused by Aelurostrongylus sp. Histologically, the main findings associated with influenza in all cats were bronchointerstitial pneumonia and marked random hepatic necrosis. In addition, all animals displayed lymphoid necrosis in the spleen and Peyer's patches and necrosis of the adrenal cortex. Immunohistochemically, nucleoprotein of HPAIV was present intralesionally in the lungs, liver, adrenal glands, and lymphoid tissues. Oropharyngeal swabs were shown to be suited to detect HPAIV by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in these cats, despite the paucity of influenza virus antigen in the upper respiratory tract by means of immunohistochemistry. The results show that outdoor cats in areas affected by HPAIV in wild birds are at risk for lethal infection. In conclusion, hepatic necrosis was, besides bronchointerstitial pneumonia, the primary lesion, suggesting that in naturally infected cats, damage to the liver plays an important role in the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza."

A total of 5878 C. felis adults were recovered; 14.6% fleas were observed to harbor Steinina ctenocephali. Female fleas were more susceptible to gregarine infection than males. Further, fleas were more likely to be infected with the gregarine at high temperatures, particularly during March-July with high parasite prevalence and intensity.

    "abstract": "Fine flexible wire microelectrodes chronically implanted in the fifth lumbar ventral root (L5 VR) of 17 cats rendered stable records of the natural discharge patterns of 164 individual axons during locomotion on a treadmill. Fifty-one out of 164 axons were identified as motoneurons projecting to the anterior thigh muscle group. For these axons, the centrifugal propagation of action potentials was demonstrated by the technique of spike-triggered averaging using signals recorded from cuff electrodes implanted around the femoral nerve. The axonal conduction velocity was measured from the femoral nerve cuff records. For 43/51 motoneurons, the corresponding target muscle was identified by spike-triggered averaging of signals recorded from bipolar EMG electrodes implanted in each of the anterior thigh muscles: vastus intermedius, medialis and lateralis, sartorius anterior and medialis, and rectus femoris. For 32/51 motoneurons, the recruitment threshold during locomotion was determined from the mean value of the rectified digitally smoothed EMG of the target muscle measured at the time when the motoneuron fired its first spike for each step. The recruitment threshold of every motoneuron was relatively constant for a given speed of walking, but for some units there were small systematic variations as a function of treadmill speed (range: 0.1-1.3 m/s). Recruitment thresholds were standardized with respect to the mean value of peak EMG activity of the target muscle during 16 s of walking at 0.5 m/s. For 28/51 motoneurons recorded in nine cats, recruitment thresholds (range: 3-93% of peak target muscle EMG) were linearly correlated (r = 0.51, P less than 0.02) to axonal conduction velocities (range: 57-117 m/s). In addition, for seven recorded pairs of motoneurons that projected to the same muscle in the same cat, the recruitment thresholds were ordered by relative conduction velocities. Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that, in normal cat locomotion up to a medium trot, anterior thigh motoneurons are progressively recruited in an orderly fashion."

Examination by imaging (ultrasonography and computerized tomography) revealed a conglomerate of cystic lesions, with mobile contents within the cyst. The serology (immunoblot) for Echinococcus sp. was positive (21 and 31 kDa bands). This case is the first reported in Rondonia, suggesting the need to investigate the polycystic echinococcosis in individuals with hepatic cysts from areas of tropical forest and hunting habits where wild life was present as wild dogs, cats and rodents, particularly Agouti paca (paca) and Dasyprocta aguti (agouti)."

Preoperative stabilization of the hyperthyroid cat with antithyroid drugs is preferred to minimize anesthetic and surgical complications. Multiple surgical techniques for thyroidectomy have been reported, and results of surgery and complications differ between techniques. The extracapsular technique offers the most complete removal of abnormal thyroid tissue, while still being associated with a low incidence of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. Important postoperative considerations are to carefully monitor serum calcium concentrations and treat hypocalcemia if necessary, and to monitor the cat for evidence of relapse of hyperthyroidism."

    "abstract": "Heartworm, a chronic fatal mosquito-borne canine disease, is frequently diagnosed in dogs from the State of Rio de Janeiro, where its prevalence is 29.7% in the city of Niterói. Nevertheless it is rarely detected in cats (0.8%) from the same state. Dogs are the primary source of infection to mosquitoes, because cats either do not demonstrate microfilaremia or it is too low and transient for transmission. A mosquito survey was conducted in Itacoatiara, Niterói, from March 1995 to February 1996, using canine, feline and human baits. A total of 21 mosquito species (3,888 females) was collected and biting frequency was highest at dusk. The four species collected most frequently (88.9%) were: Aedes taeniorhynchus (30% of the total catch; with the peak in May/June); Culex quinquefasciatus (22.5%; August/October); Aedes scapularis (19.4%; August, October/November and January) and Culex declarator (17%; November/January). Human baits were attractive to these species and dogs were significantly more attractive to them than cats. Ae. taeniorhynchus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Ae. scapularis, Cx. declarator and Cx. nigripalpus are the most likely mosquito species to transmit Dirofilaria immitis parasites to dogs and may transmit the parasite to humans. It is also suggested that the vector to cats belongs to the genus Culex"

When healthy cats were put on a raw fish diet in controlled conditions, a remarkable increase in plasma lipid peroxide was observed. This increase occurred within 1 to 3 weeks in cats without obvious clinical disorders. We also showed that a continuous raw fish diet is necessary to cause the increase, but the increase was transient and restored in spite of a continuous raw fish diet, indicating the development of an unidentified antioxidant process. Our results clearly indicate that intake of foods high in polyunsaturated fatty acid can induce oxidative stress in cats."

    "abstract": "The receptive fields of neurons in primary visual cortex that are inactivated by retinal damage are known to 'shift' to nondamaged retinal locations, seemingly due to the plasticity of intracortical connections. We have observed in cats that these shifts occur in a pattern that is highly convergent, even among receptive fields that are separated by large distances before inactivation. Here we show, using a computational model of primary visual cortex, that the observed convergent shifts are inconsistent with the common assumption that the underlying intracortical connection plasticity is dependent on the temporal correlation of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. The shifts are, however, consistent with the hypothesis that this plasticity is dependent on the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. This convergent reorganization seems to require increased neuronal gain, revealing a mechanism that networks may use to selectively facilitate the didactic transfer of neuronal response properties."

In each study, eight domestic shorthair cats were randomly allocated to each treatment group and individually housed. One group in each study remained non-treated. In one study, an additional group of eight cats was treated with a placebo formulation. Cats were treated topically with metaflumizone formulation to provide a dose of at least 40 mg metaflumizone/kg. Cats were infested with 100 cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis felis) once per week for approximately 8 weeks. Cats were comb counted 48 h after treatment and each infestation to determine the number of viable fleas present. There were no significant differences in flea counts between the non-treated control and the placebo-treated control (P > 0.05) other than a 26% reduction at week 1, demonstrating that the formulation excipients had no activity. Metaflumizone treatment resulted in significantly lower flea numbers relative to non-treated controls on all post-treatment count days (P < 0.05). Metaflumizone provided >90% control of flea infestations up to 7 weeks following a single treatment. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V."

    "abstract": "Exposure of rats to cats (predator stress) lastingly increases rodent anxiety-like behavior (ALB) in the elevated plus-maze. Previous work shows that lasting changes in ALB following predator stress depend on NMDA and CCKB receptors. In this paper we describe the effects of differing degrees of predator exposure on behavior. Effects depend on the behavioral measure. In general, exposure to predator odor is less provocative of lasting change in ALB than is unprotected exposure to a cat. In addition, we examine the development of effects of unprotected predator exposure over time. Lasting effects on ALB begin at 30 min to 1 h after predator stress and persist for at least 3 weeks. We also report a complex pattern of effects of predator stress on neuroendocrine and stress peptide (bombesin, CRF and AVP) levels in a variety of brain areas. Not surprisingly, predator exposure increases plasma levels of corticosterone and ACTH. Central changes in peptide content in the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, related hypothalamic nuclei, limbic and brain stem areas are also noted. Finally, path analysis demonstrates a replicable relationship between cat behavior, rat defensive behavior and degree of increase in ALB one week later. It is proposed that behavioral changes following predator stress may model anxiety associated with PTSD."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate echocardiograms from normal cats for the presence of physiologic valve regurgitation (PVR). BACKGROUND: PVR occurs commonly in normal dogs, however, the percentage of normal cats with PVR has not been previously reported. ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Echocardiograms were retrospectively and prospectively evaluated from clinically normal cats without echocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease. PVR was diagnosed if the valve was structurally normal and regurgitant color flow was subjectively trivial. The color jet area was expressed as a percentage of the chamber area. Results are expressed as mean+/-SD. RESULTS: Retrospective study: The 46 cats were 2.1+/-1.5 years (range 0.3-7 years) and were purebred. Four cats (9%) had physiologic mitral regurgitation (PMR) (area of 4%). One cat (2%) had physiologic pulmonary regurgitation (PPR). Twenty-seven cats (57%) had physiologic tricuspid regurgitation (PTR) (area of 6+/-3% to 11+/-8% depending on view). Prospective study: The 58 cats were 4.9+/-2.8 years (range 1-12 years), weighed 5.2+/-1.2kg and were of various breeds. Three cats (5%) had PMR (area of 10+/-2%). One cat (2%) had PPR. Forty-one cats (71%) had PTR (area of 9+/-5% to 11+/-6% depending on view). Retrospective and prospective data were pooled (104 cats) and 7 cats (7%) had PMR, 2 cats (2%) had PPR and 68 cats (65%) had PTR. CONCLUSIONS: PTR is common in normal cats and the average regurgitant jet area is small compared to the chamber area."

    "abstract": "The mammalian spinal cord contains a locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) that can produce alternating rhythmic activity of flexor and extensor motoneurones in the absence of rhythmic input and proprioceptive feedback. During such fictive locomotor activity in decerebrate cats, spontaneous omissions of activity occur simultaneously in multiple agonist motoneurone pools for a number of cycles. During these 'deletions', antagonist motoneurone pools usually become tonically active but may also continue to be rhythmic. The rhythmic activity that re-emerges following a deletion is often not phase shifted. This suggests that some neuronal mechanism can maintain the locomotor period when motoneurone activity fails. To account for these observations, a simplified computational model of the spinal circuitry has been developed in which the locomotor CPG consists of two levels: a half-centre rhythm generator (RG) and a pattern formation (PF) network, with reciprocal inhibitory interactions between antagonist neural populations at each level. The model represents a network of interacting neural populations with single interneurones and motoneurones described in the Hodgkin-Huxley style. The model reproduces the range of locomotor periods and phase durations observed during real locomotion in adult cats and permits independent control of the level of motoneurone activity and of step cycle timing. By altering the excitability of neural populations within the PF network, the model can reproduce deletions in which motoneurone activity fails but the phase of locomotor oscillations is maintained. The model also suggests criteria for the functional identification of spinal interneurones involved in the mammalian locomotor pattern generation."

Experiment 1 replicated the faster identification of snakes and spiders but also found a set size effect in a blocked, but not in a mixed-trial, sequence. Experiment 2 failed to find faster identification of snake and spider deviants relative to other animals among flowers and mushrooms and provided evidence for a search advantage for pictures of animals, irrespective of their fear relevance. These findings suggest that results from the present visual search task cannot support the notion of preferential processing of fear relevance."

    "abstract": "We have recorded intracellularly from pairs of neurons less than 500 microm distant from one another in V1 of anesthetized cats. Cross-correlation of spontaneous fluctuations in membrane potential revealed significant correlations between the cells in each pair. This synchronization was not dependent on the occurrence of action potentials, indicating that it was not caused by mutual interconnections. The cells were synchronized continuously rather than for brief epochs. Much weaker correlations were found between the EEG and intracellular potentials, suggesting local, rather than global, synchrony. The highest correlation occurred among cells with similar connectivity from the LGN and similar receptive fields. During visual stimulation, correlations increased when both cells responded to the stimulus and decreased when neither cell responded."

    "abstract": "Several aspects of perception, particularly those pertaining to vision, are closely linked to the occipital alpha (alpha) rhythm. However, how the alpha rhythm relates to the activity of neurons that convey primary visual information is unknown. Here we show that in behaving cats, thalamocortical neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) that operate in a conventional relay-mode form two groups where the cumulative firing is subject to a cyclic suppression that is centered on the negative alpha rhythm peak in one group and on the positive peak in the other. This leads to an effective temporal framing of relay-mode output and results from phasic inhibition from LGN interneurons, which in turn are rhythmically excited by thalamocortical neurons that exhibit high-threshold bursts. These results provide a potential cellular substrate for linking the alpha rhythm to perception and further underscore the central role of inhibition in controlling spike timing during cognitively relevant brain oscillations."

Methods: The relationship among exhaled nitric oxide, underlying disease and home environmental exposures was examined using question- naire data and measurement of exhaled nitric oxide in a cross-sectional study of 1135 children that included healthy children, and children with allergies and/or asthma who were attending grades 4 through 6 in Windsor, Ontario. ResuLts: Among healthy children, there was a positive association between FeNO and occupancy (P<0.02). Compared with forced air and hot water radiant heat, electric baseboard heating was associated with a significant increase of FeNO in healthy children (P=0.007) and children with allergies (P=0.043). FeNO was not associated with environmental tobacco smoke exposure or reported surface mold. The presence of pet dog(s), but not cats, was associated with a significantly lower FeNO in healthy children (P<0.001) and in children with reported allergies (P<0.001). ConCLusions: The type of heating system, but not previously reported environmental tobacco smoke or mold exposure appears to affect exhaled nitric oxide in children. Exposure to different types of pets may have disparate effects on airway inflammation."

    "abstract": "In considering the violence of “yesterday’s victim” in postcolonial Africa, Mahmood Mamdani warns of the danger of becoming locked into the world of the rat and the cat. This is the political world of the victim and the perpetrator, the Hutu and the Tutsi, the Palestinian and the Israeli, or to use Frantz Fanon’s terms, the native and the settler;3 a world in which identities are generated endlessly in binary pairs. The rat believes there is no worse enemy than the cat, not the lion, the tiger or the elephant, while for the cat there is nothing more delicious than the rat. In a world in which cats are few and rats are many, one way cats have stabilized their rule, according to Mamdani, is by “tagging” rats with a discourse on ethnic and racial origins. It is then quite possible that in a world where rats have managed to triumph over cats, rats may continue living in a world defined by cats, that is, by identities generated in the era when cats ruled.4 While Mamdani’s specific concern, the Rwandan genocide of 1994, illuminates with chilling clarity the necessity of breaking out of the worldview of the rat, I want to point to a broader relevancy in the following paper."

    "abstract": "Endogenous neuromodulatory molecules are commonly coupled to specific metabolic enzymes to ensure rapid signal inactivation. Thus, acetylcholine is hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase and tryptamine neurotransmitters like serotonin are degraded by monoamine oxidases. Previously, we reported the structure and sleep-inducing properties of cis-9-octadecenamide, a lipid isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep-deprived cats. cis-9-Octadecenamide, or oleamide, has since been shown to affect serotonergic systems and block gap-junction communication in glial cells (our unpublished results). We also identified a membrane-bound enzyme activity that hydrolyses oleamide to its inactive acid, oleic acid. We now report the mechanism-based isolation, cloning and expression of this enzyme activity, originally named oleamide hydrolase, from rat liver plasma membranes. We also show that oleamide hydrolase converts anandamide, a fatty-acid amide identified as the endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptor, to arachidonic acid, indicating that oleamide hydrolase may serve as the general inactivating enzyme for a growing family of bioactive signalling molecules, the fatty-acid amides. Therefore we will hereafter refer to oleamide hydrolase as fatty-acid amide hydrolase, in recognition of the plurality of fatty-acid amides that the enzyme can accept as substrates."

    "abstract": "Phylogenies underpin comparative biology as high-utility tools to test evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses, inform on conservation strategies, and reveal the age and evolutionary histories of traits and lineages. As tools, most powerful are those phylogenies that contain all, or nearly all, of the taxa of a given group. Despite their obvious utility, such phylogenies, other than summary 'supertrees', are currently lacking for most mammalian orders, including the order Carnivora. Carnivora consists of about 270 extant species including most of the world's large terrestrial predators (e.g., the big cats, wolves, bears), as well as many of man's favorite wild (panda, cheetah, tiger) and domesticated animals (dog, cat). Distributed globally, carnivores are highly diverse ecologically, having occupied all major habitat types on the planet and being diverse in traits such as sociality, communication, body/brain size, and foraging ecology. Thus, numerous studies continue to address comparative questions within the order, highlighting the need for a detailed species-level phylogeny. Here we present a phylogeny of Carnivora that increases taxon sampling density from 28% in the most detailed primary-data study to date, to 82% containing 243 taxa (222 extant species, 17 subspecies). In addition to extant species, we sampled four extinct species: American cheetah, saber-toothed cat, cave bear and the giant short-faced bear. Bayesian analysis of cytochrome b sequences data-mined from GenBank results in a phylogenetic hypothesis that is largely congruent with prior studies based on fewer taxa but more characters. We find support for the monophyly of Carnivora, its major division into Caniformia and Feliformia, and for all but one family within the order. The only exception is the placement of the kinkajou outside Procyonidae, however, prior studies have already cast doubt on its family placement. In contrast, at the subfamily and genus level, our results indicate numerous problems with current classification. Our results also propose new, controversial hypotheses, such as the possible placement of the red panda (Ailuridae) sister to canids (Canidae). Our results confirm previous findings suggesting that the dog was domesticated from the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus) and are congruent with the Near East domestication of the cat. In sum, this study presents the most detailed species-level phylogeny of Carnivora to date and a much needed tool for comparative studies of carnivoran species. To demonstrate one such use, we perform a phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary distinctiveness (EDGE), which can be used to help establish conservation priorities. According with those criteria, and under one of the many possible sets of parameters, the highest priority Carnivora species for conservation of evolutionary diversity include: monk seals, giant and red panda, giant otter, otter civet, Owston's palm civet, sea otter, Liberian mongoose, spectacled bear, walrus, binturong, and the fossa."

Patients' ability to fill out lengthy questionnaires is compromised by many factors. Computer-adaptive tests (CAT) offer a promising approach to developing tailored instruments, that administer only items relevant to the individual patient. A systematic review of the literature about CATs in medical databases was conducted. Based on the results, a method for developing a CAT was designed that requires nine steps: (1) build an item pool; (2) administer the items to a predefined sample in a calibration study; (3) eliminate inappropriate items; (4) examine whether all items are influenced by a single dominant trait; (5) calibrate the items to the best-fitting item response theory (IRT) model; (6) evaluate items' parameter equivalence across subgroups; (7) build an item bank with the calibrated items; (8) develop the CAT; and (9) pilot test the developed CAT. CAT offers the chance to extend the usefulness of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurements from clinical studies to daily clinical practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

Because C fibers play a key role in reflex micturition in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), we investigated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on micturition in SCI cats. We also investigated GR-46611 (3-[3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-yl]-N-(4-methoxybenzyl)acrylamide) , which has agonist activity predominantly at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors but also at the 5-HT1A receptor. Chloralose-anesthetized cats were catheterized through the bladder dome for saline-filling cystometry. Dose-response curves for i.v. 8-OH-DPAT (0.3-30 microg/kg) and GR-46611 (0.03-300 microg/kg) were followed in three cases each by 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 [N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazin-1-yl)-2-phenylpropanamide] at 300 microg/kg. Threshold volume, capacity, residual volume, micturition volume, and arterial pressure were measured. Intact cats showed few significant changes in cystometric variables. SCI cats responded to both 8-OH-DPAT and GR-46611 with dose-dependent increases in threshold volume, capacity, and residual volume, significant at > or =10 microg/kg for 8-OH-DPAT and at > or =3 microg/kg for GR-46611. Effects of 8-OH-DPAT but not GR-46611 were largely reversed by WAY-100635. Both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/1D agonists may offer a promising means of reducing bladder hyperactivity and increasing bladder capacity in patients with chronic SCI."

    "abstract": "The presence or development of malnutrition during critical illness has been unequivocally associated with increased morbidity and mortality in people. Recognition that malnutrition may similarly affect veterinary patients emphasizes the need to properly address the nutritional requirements of hospitalized dogs and cats. Because of a lack in veterinary studies evaluating the nutritional requirements of critically ill small animals, current recommendations for nutritional support of veterinary patients are based largely on sound clinical judgment and the best information available, including data from experimental animal models and human studies. This, however, should not discourage the veterinary practitioner from implementing nutritional support in critically ill patients. Similar to many supportive measures of critically ill patients, nutritional interventions can have a significant impact on patient morbidity and may even improve survival. The first step of nutritional support is to identify patients most likely to benefit from nutritional intervention. Careful assessment of the patient and appraisal of its nutritional needs provide the basis for a nutritional plan, which includes choosing the optimal route of nutritional support, determining the number of calories to provide, and determining the composition of the diet. Ultimately, the success of the nutritional management of critically ill dogs and cats will depend on close monitoring and frequent reassessment."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and pathologic findings associated with an outbreak of cryptococcosis in an unusual geographic location (British Columbia, Canada). DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 1 pink-fronted cockatoo, 2 ferrets, 20 cats, and 15 dogs. PROCEDURE: A presumptive diagnosis of cryptococcosis was made on the basis of serologic, histopathologic, or cytologic findings, and a definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of culture or immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: No breed or sex predilections were detected in affected dogs or cats. Eleven cats had neurologic signs, 7 had skin lesions, and 5 had respiratory tract signs. None of 17 cats tested serologically for FeLV yielded positive results; 1 of 17 cats yielded positive results for FIV (western blot). Nine of 15 dogs had neurologic signs, 2 had periorbital swellings, and only 3 had respiratory tract signs initially. Microbiologic culture in 15 cases yielded 2 isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans var grubii (serotype A) and 13 isolates of C. neoformans var gattii (serotype B); all organisms were susceptible to amphotericin B and ketoconazole. Serologic testing had sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 98%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Serologic titers were beneficial in identifying infection in animals with nonspecific signs, but routine serum biochemical or hematologic parameters were of little value in diagnosis. Most animals had nonspecific CNS signs and represented a diagnostic challenge. Animals that travel to or live in this region and have nonspecific malaise or unusual neurologic signs should be evaluated for cryptococcosis."

    "abstract": "This article reviews the literature on the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in dogs, cats and horses. Over the past 10 years, MRSA has emerged as an important pathogen in veterinary medicine, especially in countries with a high MRSA burden in human hospitals. During the same period, community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections in humans without apparent links to healthcare facilities have increased dramatically. Although animal infections occur outside human hospitals, significant epidemiological, clinical and genetic differences exist between CA-MRSA in humans and the majority of MRSA infections in the different animal species. The recognition of MRSA in animals has raised concern over their role as potential reservoirs or vectors for human MRSA infection in the community. However, available data on MRSA transmission between humans and companion animals are limited and the public health impact of such transmission needs to be the subject of more detailed epidemiological studies."

Group-housed cats were kept in one room with three cat trays and a common water and feed tray. Eighteen (51.4%) of 35 group-housed cats, 5 (8.6%) of 58 diseased cats (5/58), and 1 (0.36%) of 278 healthy house cats excreted Salmonella. Salmonella isolates were of serotypes Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Bovismorbificans and 4:i:-. Acquired antimicrobial resistance was found in serotype Typhimurium (resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline; to ampicillin; and to chloramphenicol) and 4:i:- strains (resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim).

ANIMALS: 105 cats from the United States, Canada; and the United Kingdom with a confirmed diagnosis of acquired MG and 510 cats with other neuromuscular disorders, including generalized weakness, megaesophagus, and dysphagia (control group). PROCEDURES: Records were retrieved from a data-base containing results of serum samples tested for acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Signalment, including breed, age, and state or country of origin, month of onset, and initial clinical signs were obtained. An acetylcholine receptor antibody titer > 0.3 nmol/L was diagnostic for acquired MG. Unconditional logistic regression was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Compared with mixed-breed cats, the breed with the highest relative risk of acquired MG was the Abyssinian (including Somali). Significant differences between sexes were not detected. There was no compelling evidence for a difference in risk of developing MG between states or countries. Relative risk increased after 3 years of age. The most common clinical signs were generalized weakness without megaesophagus and weakness associated with a cranial mediastinal mass. Focal signs, including megaesophagus and dysphagia without signs of generalized weakness, were also evident. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A breed predisposition for acquired MG in Abyssinians (and related Somalis) was observed. Clinical signs were variable and included generalized weakness, megaesophagus, and dysphagia. A cranial mediastinal mass was commonly associated with MG in cats."

    "abstract": "The rate of stepping in the hind legs of chronic spinal and decerebrate cats adapts to the speed of the treadmill on which the animals walk. This adaptive behavior depends on sensory signals generated near the end of stance phase controlling the transition from stance to swing. Two sensory signals have been identified to have this role: one from afferents activated by hip extension, most likely arising from muscle spindles in hip flexor muscles, and the other from group Ib afferents from Golgi tendon organs in the ankle extensor muscles. The relative importance of these two signals in controlling the stance to swing transition differs in chronic spinal cats and in decerebrate cats. Activation of hip afferents is necessary for controlling the transition in chronic spinal cats but not in decerebrate cats, while reduction in activity in group Ib afferents from GTOs is the primary factor controlling the transition in decerebrate cats. Possible mechanisms for this difference are discussed. The extent to which these two sensory signals control the stance to swing transition in normal walking cats is unknown, but it is likely that both could play an important role when animals are walking in a variable environment."

    "abstract": "Like domestic cats, wild felids are involved in the complete infective cycle of Toxoplasma gondii because they can host in their gastrointestinal tract sexually mature parasites and shed infective oocysts in their feces. We report, to our knowledge, the first isolation and molecular characterization of a T. gondii strain from the heart tissue of a free-living jaguar (Panthera onca) in French Guiana. Sequencing at six polymorphic markers indicated that the jaguar isolate had an atypical genotype, including an allele at TgM-A previously found only in isolates from South America, and an allele at GRA6, which was previously reported only in Californian sea otter isolates. These findings are consistent with the recent description of atypical T gondii strains involved in severe toxoplasmoses in immunocompetent patients in French Guiana that seemed to be linked to a neotropical forest-based cycle involving wild cats and their prey."

Lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF) mRNA were measured in muscle and fat tissue with real-time PCR using primers for feline LPL, HSL, and TNF. Lipoprotein lipase plasma and fat activity and fat mRNA levels were significantly lower (50, 80, and 50%, respectively) in obese cats than lean cats, whereas the muscle/fat ratio of LPL was significantly higher in obese compared to lean cats. The activity of HL was not different between the groups. Hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA levels were significantly higher in obese than lean cats. The level of fat TNF also was significantly higher in obese cats than in lean cats, whereas the level in muscle was not different. The lower LPL activity and mRNA expression in fat and the higher LPL and HSL mRNA expression in muscle in obese cats compared to lean cats expectedly favor a redistribution of fatty acids from fat to muscle tissue where they can be deposited or used for energy in times of need. Tumor necrosis factor alpha may regulate this repartitioning process through suppression of adipocyte LPL."

    "abstract": "The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB, www.iedb.org) provides a catalog of experimentally characterized B and T cell epitopes, as well as data on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) binding and MHC ligand elution experiments. The database represents the molecular structures recognized by adaptive immune receptors and the experimental contexts in which these molecules were determined to be immune epitopes. Epitopes recognized in humans, nonhuman primates, rodents, pigs, cats and all other tested species are included. Both positive and negative experimental results are captured. Over the course of 4 years, the data from 180,978 experiments were curated manually from the literature, which covers approximately 99% of all publicly available information on peptide epitopes mapped in infectious agents (excluding HIV) and 93% of those mapped in allergens. In addition, data that would otherwise be unavailable to the public from 129,186 experiments were submitted directly by investigators. The curation of epitopes related to autoimmunity is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. The database can be queried by epitope structure, source organism, MHC restriction, assay type or host organism, among other criteria. The database structure, as well as its querying, browsing and reporting interfaces, was completely redesigned for the IEDB 2.0 release, which became publicly available in early 2009."

    "abstract": "The medical records of 11 cats with full-thickness intestinal biopsies and histopathologic confirmation of segmental mucosal fibrosis were reviewed. All cats received an abdominal ultrasonographic evaluation. The sonographic feature of a small intestinal mucosal hyperechoic band paralleling the submucosa was present in all cats. Other intestinal sonographic findings included wall thickening, and altered wall layering (increased mu- cosal echogenicity, thickened submucosa, and/or muscularis layer). None of the cats had complete loss of wall stratification. All cats had clinical signs related to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract at the time of presentation. Three of the 11 cats had palpably thickened small intestinal loops, 3/11 abdominal pain, and 2/11 abdominal fluid. Histopathologically, mucosal fibrosis was associated with inflammatory cell infiltrates in all cats. In those cats with histopathologic evidence of mural fibrosis, all cats had a visible hyperechoic band through several intestinal segments. We speculate that the hyperechoic mucosal band represents the zone of mucosal fibrosis. Independently and prospectively, we reviewed the clinical presentation of 35 cats having this visible hyperechoic mucosal band on ultrasound. Twenty-four of these 35 cats had clinical signs related to the digestive system at the time of record. Our study suggests that the hyperechoic mucosal band represents fibrosis, and in presence of concurrent GI signs, further diagnostic tests may be warranted."

All cats had an acute onset of nonpainful, asymmetrical spinal cord signs (paresis or paralysis of one or more limbs). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in three cats. On T2-weighted images, an intramedullary lesion was revealed that was hyperintense to normal spinal cord gray matter. On T1-weighted images, the lesion was isointense. Three of the cats were euthanized, and postmortem examination confirmed myelomalacia with intralesional fibrocartilaginous emboli. Two cats survived and were clinically improved within 3 weeks."

    "abstract": "Objective-To determine whether administration of inactivated virus or modified-live virus (MLV) vaccines to feral cats at the time of neutering induces protective serum antiviral antibody titers. Design-Prospective study. Animals-61 feral cats included in a trap-neuter-return program in Florida. Procedures-Each cat received vaccines against feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline herpes virus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), FeLV, and rabies virus (RV). Immediately on completion of surgery, vaccines that contained inactivated RV and FeLV antigens and either MLV or inactivated FPV, FHV, and FCV antigens were administered. Titers of antiviral antibodies (except those against FeLV) were assessed in serum samples obtained immediately prior to surgery and approximately 10 weeks later. Results-Prior to vaccination, some of the cats had protective serum antibody titers against FPV (33%), FHV (21%), FCV (64%), and RV (3%). Following vaccination, the overall proportion of cats with protective serum antiviral antibody titers increased (FPV [90%], FHV [56%], FCV [93%], and RV [98%]). With the exception of the FHV vaccine, there were no differences in the proportions of cats protected with inactivated virus versus MLV vaccines. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggest that exposure to FPV FHV and FCV is common among feral cats and that a high proportion of cats are susceptible to RV infection. Feral cats appeared to have an excellent immune response following vaccination at the time of neutering. Incorporation of vaccination into trap-neuter-return programs is likely to protect the health of individual cats and possibly reduce the disease burden in the community."

    "abstract": "Objectives: To study the prognosis and cause of death in cats with diabetes mellitus. Methods: Twenty consecutive cases of feline diabetes mellitus diagnosed in first-opinion practice were followed. Three control cats, without diabetes, were matched to each case of diabetes; these were also followed. Results: One Somali cat with diabetes could not be matched, so complete data analysis considered only 19 diabetics and 57 matched controls. Death occurred in 14 of 20 diabetics and 23 of 57 controls although one control cat was eventually lost to follow-up. Heart disease and heart failure led to death in six diabetic cats. One of these was the non-matched Somali; nevertheless, the death rate from heart disease in the diabetics was five of 19 compared with two of 57 in controls. The relative risk of heart failure in diabetic cats was 10.4 times that of the controls; this difference in rates was statistically significant. Survival amongst diabetics was significantly worse than for controls. For the control cats median survival was 718 days after the index visit, whereas for the diabetic cases median survival was 385 days after diagnosis. Clinical Significance: Heart disease and failure are common in diabetic cats. This observation deserves further attention."

    "abstract": "Objective-To estimate the number of unowned free-roaming cats in a college community in the southern United States and identify the characteristics of community residents who feed these cats. Design-Cross-sectional, random-digit telephone survey. Sample Population-587 households in Alachua County, Florida, surveyed between March 1 and May 10, 1999. Procedure-Telephone surveys were conducted, and respondents were asked questions about feeding of unowned free-roaming cats. Results-70 (12%) households fed free-roaming cats; mean +/- SD number of free-roaming cats fed per household was 3.6 +/- 1.9. Households that fed free-roaming cats were more likely to own pet cats than were households that did not feed free-roaming cats; however, 30 of 70 (43%) households feeding free-roaming cats did not own cats or dogs. Although the percentage of pet cats that were neutered was high (90%), only 8 (11%) households that fed free-roaming cats attempted to have such cats neutered. The free-roaming cat population was estimated to represent approximately 44% of the population of cats in the county. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggest that unowned free-roaming cats may represent a substantial portion of the total cat population in a region. Public policies and education programs aimed at reducing cat overpopulation should include provisions for neutering unowned free-roaming cats, and efforts should target the general public, not only pet owners, because not all households that feed unowned free-roaming cats own pets."

    "abstract": "Activity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is essential for normal sound localization behavior, but previous studies of the spatial sensitivity of neurons in A1 have found broad spatial tuning. We tested the hypothesis that spatial tuning sharpens when an animal engages in an auditory task. Cats performed a task that required evaluation of the locations of sounds and one that required active listening, but in which sound location was irrelevant. Some 26-44% of the units recorded in A1 showed substantially sharpened spatial tuning during the behavioral tasks as compared with idle conditions, with the greatest sharpening occurring during the location-relevant task. Spatial sharpening occurred on a scale of tens of seconds and could be replicated multiple times in ∼1.5-h test sessions. Sharpening resulted primarily from increased suppression of responses to sounds at least-preferred locations. That and an observed increase in latencies suggest an important role of inhibitory mechanisms."

METHODS: Records of cats diagnosed with lymphoma of extranodal sites at seven referral centres were reviewed and information on signalment, tumour location, prior treatment and chemotherapy protocol recorded. Factors influencing response to treatment and survival were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine cases met inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine cats had nasal lymphoma, 35 renal, 15 central nervous system, 11 laryngeal and 19 miscellaneous locations. Sixty-six cats received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, 25 Wisconsin-Madison doxorubicin-containing multi-agent protocol, 10 prednisolone alone and nine other combinations. The response rate for the 110 treated cats was 85.5 per cent. Of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone treated cats 72.7 per cent achieved complete remission, median survival 239 days. Sixty-four per cent of Wisconsin-Madison treated cats achieved complete remission, median survival 563 days. Cats with nasal lymphoma achieving complete remission had the longest survival (749 days) and cats with central nervous system lymphoma the shortest (70 days). If complete remission was achieved, prior treatment with corticosteroids significantly reduced survival time. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Cats with extranodal lymphoma respond to chemotherapy and achieve survival times comparable to other locations. Corticosteroid pretreatment reduced survival time in cats achieving complete remission."

    "abstract": "The present study is aimed at finding taste reactivity patterns in domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) which reflect 'liking' or perceived palatability. Three groups of nonstressed cats living in households were formed which a priori were expected to differ in motivational state for eating food items (more or less hungry), and which were offered two different food items differing in general taste properties (more or less flavourful food, MFF and LFF, respectively) around the time that they were fed their normal food. Analysis of the amount of food eaten showed that MFF was consumed regardless of hunger level and that LFF was consumed depending on the hunger level of cats: the more hungry cats ate more of LFF than the less hungry cats. Analysis of post-meal behavioural sequences showed that the 'MFF consumption sequence' differed from the 'LFF refusal sequence' and that the 'LFF consumption sequence' strongly resembled the 'MFF consumption sequence' but also contained elements of the 'LFF refusal sequence'. Subsequent analysis of the frequencies and total durations of behavioural patterns showed that two kinds of patterns existed, possibly reflecting two 'palatability dimensions': hedonic taste reactivity patterns (lick/sniff feeding bowl, lip lick and groom face) and aversive taste reactivity patterns (lick/sniff food and lick nose). These dimensions may be combined to obtain a single palatability score."

    "abstract": "The latent prevalence of a long-lived and common brain parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, explains a statistically significant portion of the variance in aggregate neuroticism among populations, as well as in the 'neurotic' cultural dimensions of sex roles and uncertainty avoidance. Spurious or non-causal correlations between aggregate personality and aspects of climate and culture that influence T. gondii transmission could also drive these patterns. A link between culture and T. gondii hypothetically results from a behavioural manipulation that the parasite uses to increase its transmission to the next host in the life cycle: a cat. While latent toxoplasmosis is usually benign, the parasite's subtle effect on individual personality appears to alter the aggregate personality at the population level. Drivers of the geographical variation in the prevalence of this parasite include the effects of climate on the persistence of infectious stages in soil, the cultural practices of food preparation and cats as pets. Some variation in culture, therefore, may ultimately be related to how climate affects the distribution of T. gondii, though the results only explain a fraction of the variation in two of the four cultural dimensions, suggesting that if T. gondii does influence human culture, it is only one among many factors."

Gastrointestinal content (i.e. content from the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) was collected from four healthy conventionally raised colony cats and one healthy specific pathogen-free (SPF) cat. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using universal bacterial primers and analyzed by comparative sequence analysis. A total of 1008 clones were analyzed and 109 nonredundant 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified. In the four conventionally raised cats, five different bacterial phyla were observed, with sequences predominantly classified in the phylum Firmicutes (68%), followed by Proteobacteria (14%), Bacteroidetes (10%), Fusobacteria (5%), and Actinobacteria (4%). The majority of clones fell within the order Clostridiales (54%), followed by Lactobacillales, Bacteroidales, Campylobacterales, and Fusobacteriales (14%, 11%, 10%, and 6%, respectively). Clostridiales were predominantly affiliated with Clostridium clusters I (58%) and XIVa (27%). The intestinal microbiota of the SPF cat displayed a reduced bacterial diversity, with 98% of all clones classified in the phylum Firmicutes. Further classification showed that the Firmicutes clones belonged exclusively to the class Clostridiales and were predominantly affiliated with Clostridium cluster I."

    "abstract": "The American sabercat Smilodon fatalis is among the most charismatic of fossil carnivores. Despite broad agreement that its extraordinary anatomy reflects unique hunting techniques, after >150 years of study, many questions remain concerning its predatory behavior. Were the \"sabers\" used to take down large prey? Were prey killed with an eviscerating bite to the abdomen? Was its bite powerful or weak compared with that of modern big cats? Here we quantitatively assess the sabercat's biomechanical performance using the most detailed computer reconstructions yet developed for the vertebrate skull. Our results demonstrate that bite force driven by jaw muscles was relatively weak in S. fatalis, one-third that of a lion (Panthera leo) of comparable size, and its skull was poorly optimized to resist the extrinsic loadings generated by struggling prey. Its skull is better optimized for bites on restrained prey where the bite is augmented by force from the cervical musculature. We conclude that prey were brought to ground and restrained before a killing bite, driven in large part by powerful cervical musculature. Because large prey is easier to restrain if its head is secured, the killing bite was most likely directed to the neck. We suggest that the more powerful jaw muscles of P. leo may be required for extended, asphyxiating bites and that the relatively low bite forces in S. fatalis might reflect its ability to kill large prey more quickly, avoiding the need for prolonged bites."

    "abstract": "Both anatomical and physiological studies in cats substantiated the existence of a thalamus-cortex-thalamus neuronal circuit in which neurons in the centre median send fibers to wide areas of the cerebral cortex and the cerebral cortex, the motor cortex in particular, may send the fibers back to the parafascicular nucleus. The cortical neurons concerned tend to discharge spontaneously and constantly. These spontaneous discharges can be readily inhibited by the corticopetal impulses from the centre median, which itself can be activated by general afferent impulses. On the basis of this observation it is assumed that constantly discharging corticothalamic neurons may exert a tonic excitatory influence on the pain-receiving center, parafascicular nucleus, so as to keep it in a state of constant alertness to the tissue-damaging danger signals and that the inhibitory action of the ascending fibers from centre median would serve to suspend the excitatory action of the cortex on the parafascicular nucleus, resulting in relief of pain. The corticofugal fibers in this forebrain circuit terminating in the centromedian nucleus may reinforce the inhibitory action of the centromedian neurons so as to inhibit the spontaneous discharges of the cortical neurons . A self-regulating mechanism is thus formed by which a stabilized state of brain excitability can be maintained."

    "abstract": "The aims of our study were to determine a reference range for plasma leptin in healthy, normal-weight cats and to measure the effect of weight gain on plasma leptin levels. To increase our understanding of the association between leptin and feline obesity, we investigated the relationship between plasma leptin and measures of adiposity in cats. Twenty-six normal-weight cats were used to determine the reference range for feline leptin using a multispecies radioimmunoassay. In the second part of the study, plasma leptin concentrations were determined in 16 cats before and after approximately 10 months of spontaneous weight gain. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans (DEXA) were performed after weight gain. The tolerance interval for plasma leptin concentrations was 0.92-11.9 ng/ml Human Equivalent (HE) with a mean concentration of 6.41+/-2.19 ng/ml HE. In part two of the study, 16 cats gained on average 44.2% bodyweight over 10 months. The percentage of body fat in obese cats ranged from 34.2 to 48.7%. Mean plasma leptin concentrations increased from 7.88+/-4.02 ng/ml HE before weight gain to 24.5+/-12.1 ng/ml HE after weight gain, (P<0.001). Total body fat and body fat per cent were the strongest predictors of plasma leptin in obese cats (r=0.8 and r=0.78, P<0.001, respectively). In conclusion, plasma leptin concentrations increased three-fold in cats as a result of weight gain and were strongly correlated with the amount of adipose tissue present. Despite elevated leptin levels, cats continued to eat and gain weight, suggesting decreased sensitivity to leptin. This investigation into the biology of leptin in cats may aid the overall understanding of the role of leptin and the development of future treatments to help prevent and manage feline obesity."

In a recent study using intracellular recording from neck flexor and extensor motoneurons, the neuronal connections and pathways underlying sacculocollic reflexes were determined in cats. The results showed that sacculocollic reflex displayed inhibitory connection to bilateral neck flexors and excitatory connection to bilateral neck extensors. A total of 16 normal young adults were tested with bilateral recordings of sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and splenius capitis (SC) muscles by acoustic stimulus of 500 Hz short tone burst. The results revealed that polarity of the wave I/II of VEMP on SC was the reverse of that on SCM. This implied that VEMP from ipsilateral SCM showed inhibitory neural activity; whereas VEMP from ipsilateral SC was an excitatory response. Using this non-invasive technique, the sacculocollic reflexes in human neck flexor and extensor were studied. The results in humans were consistent with the previous findings in cats."

    "abstract": "In the past decade pancreatitis has become recognised as a significant disease in the cat. Chronic, mild pancreatitis is often associated with more commonly diagnosed diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis. Furthermore, acute pancreatitis with similar complications to those seen in dogs is now diagnosed more frequently in cats. Unfortunately, the clinical signs and clinicopathological findings in cats with pancreatitis are often non-specific and vague. The lack of specific signs often results in a diagnosis being made only when the veterinary surgeon has a strong index of suspicion for pancreatitis and vigorously pursues that diagnosis. Pancreatitis is an important disease in cats, has been implicated as a potential cause of diabetes mellitus, and when present complicates the treatment of diabetes and other intra-abdominal diseases in cats."

    "abstract": "Pen and field trials were used to test the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of wire netting and electric fence designs as barriers to feral cats, foxes and rabbits in northern South Australia. A 180 cm high wire netting fence with foot apron and a curved [`]floppy' overhang effectively contained most rabbits, feral cats and foxes during pen trials and proved effective with intensively monitored paddock-scale exclosures. A reduced height fence of 115 cm did not reduce effectiveness of the fence during fence trials but paddock-scale trials are yet to be completed. Conventional 40 mm diameter hexagonal \"rabbit netting\" was not an effective barrier against young independent rabbits and it is recommended that 30 mm hexagonal netting should be used. A 60 cm wide external netting overhang, curved in an arc and supported by lengths of heavy gauge wire, effectively precluded more feral cats and foxes than a 30 cm wide overhang angled upwards. The 30 cm foot apron was augmented in erosion-prone dunes and watercourses by the addition of wider netting or rubber matting to prevent incursions. Posts, and particularly corners, were targeted by feral cats and foxes and the efficacy of the fence was improved by using steel, rather than timber posts. Electric wires offset from the netting at heights of 120 and 150 cm provided a shock to animals exploring the base of the overhang and further improved the fence efficacy. PVC conduit rollers on the top wire were not effective. Material costs ranged from AUD $8814 per km for the 115 cm high fence to AUD $12,432 per km for the 180 cm high fence with two electric wires. The non-standard 30 mm hexagonal netting accounted for 57% of the material costs of the low netting fence. Increased demand for this netting may reduce the expense of rabbit exclusion. Expenses could also be reduced where existing stock fences are modified by the addition of netting."

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most common protozoan parasites of humans and warm-blooded animals. Members of the family Felidae are the only definitive hosts of this parasite and, thus, important in the epidemiology of the disease. Previous studies on Pacific islands have found T. gondii infections in a number of avian species where domestic cats (Felis catus) have been introduced. Little is known about T. gondii in the Galapagos Islands, although introduced domestic cats in the archipelago are known to be T. gondii antibody-positive. In this study, we quantified prevalence of antibody to T. gondii in two threatened avian marine species, Galapagos Penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus) and Flightless Cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi), and tested the hypothesis that this parasite is more prevalent on Isabela Island (with cats) than on Fernandina Island (without cats). Overall, antibody prevalence was 2.3% in both Galapagos Penguins and Flightless Cormorants from samples collected during 2003-2005, and in 2008. In Galapagos Penguins (n=298), a significantly higher antibody prevalence was found in penguins on Fernandina Island (free of cats) than on Isabela Island (with cats; Fisher's exact test; P=0.02). In Flightless Cormorants (n=258), there was a higher antibody prevalence in cormorants living on Isabela than on Fernandina, although this difference was not statistically significant (Fisher's; P=0.19). This study is the first to show exposure to T. gondii in endemic avian species in the Galapagos Islands, providing evidence for disease-related risks associated with the feral cat population in the archipelago. We provide possible explanations for these findings and recommendations for future studies towards a better understanding of the epidemiology of T. gondii in the Galapagos Islands."

    "abstract": "Relaxin, a 6-kDa polypeptide hormone, is excreted in the urine during pregnancy in several mammalian species. A recent study showed that detection of urinary relaxin using a bench-top serum assay (Witness relaxin kit, Synbiotics Corp., San Diego, California 92127, USA) can be diagnostic for pregnancy in domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus), but it is unknown whether the bench-top kit is applicable with urine across felid species. Our objectives were to 1) examine modifications in urine processing to improve kit reliability in pregnant cats, 2) evaluate the impact of concentrating urine via filtration on relaxin detection, 3) assess the effect of sample freezing on relaxin concentrations, and 4) begin quantifying urinary relaxin levels in nondomestic felids. Urine and serum were collected from domestic cats and nondomestic cat species (Pallas' cat, Otocolobus manul; sand cat, Felis margarita; cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus; and lion, Panthera leo) at several times after breeding. Urine samples, subjected to various processing methods, were tested using the bench-top kit, and relaxin levels were later quantified via radioimmunoassay. For domestic cat urine samples, filtration and addition of protein/phosphate buffer improved the consistency of the relaxin kit for early pregnancy diagnosis. Urine freezing caused a slight (approximately 13%) but significant decrease in relaxin concentrations, but frozen-thawed samples still tested positive with the bench-top kit. In nondomestic felids, urinary relaxin immunoreactivity during pregnancy was similar to or higher than that of pregnant domestic cats, suggesting that relaxin is a reliable cross-species marker of pregnancy. Urinary relaxin was detectable using the bench-top kit in pregnant Pallas' cats, but urine samples from other species tested negative, regardless of processing methods. Findings suggest that measurement of urinary relaxin is a promising approach for noninvasive pregnancy diagnosis in exotic felids, but further assessment of urinary relaxin profiles among cat species and modification of the bench-top relaxin kit are warranted to improve cross-species utility."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) is a common cause of ocular and upper respiratory disease in cats and kittens, and a potential cause of eosinophilic dermatitis. HYPOTHESIS: The systemic anti-herpes drug, famciclovir (Famvir; Novartis), would be effective in the clinical management of disease attributable to FHV-1, including conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal sequestra, rhinosinusitis and FHV-1 associated dermatitis. CLINICAL OUTCOME: Oral famciclovir was used to treat signs considered referable to FHV-1 in 10 cats: four had primary ocular disease, two had rhinosinusitis and four had FHV-1 associated dermatitis. Patients treated in Australia (five cats) and Europe (one cat) were given 62.5 mg of famciclovir once or twice daily. Four cats treated in the USA were given 125 mg three times daily. Famciclovir was uniformly well tolerated and, in all cases, had a positive impact on the patient's condition. The apparent improvement in lesions was superior to what had been achieved previously using other therapeutic strategies. One cat with severe destructive rhinosinusitis was significantly improved by a 4-month course of famciclovir in combination with antibacterials. Corneal sequestra detached in two out of three cats treated; cats with ocular signs were qualitatively more comfortable, with reduced clinical signs and an improved appearance of the eyes. Critically, oral famciclovir therapy was considered more convenient than topical ocular therapy. All four cats with FHV-1 associated dermatitis improved substantially, although relapse occurred subsequently in three patients. A further cat with presumptive FHV-1 associated dermatitis responded to topical aciclovir cream before famciclovir could be sourced. CONCLUSIONS: Famciclovir appears to be a promising systemic drug for treating diseases associated with FHV-1 infection. More rigorous clinical trials are required to optimise the dosing regimen for safe and effective specific anti-herpes treatment in feline clinical medicine."

    "abstract": "OVERVIEW: Feline coronavirus infection is ubiquitous in domestic cats, and is particularly common where conditions are crowded. While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. DISEASE SIGNS: The 'wet' or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the 'dry' or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. DIAGNOSIS: The aetiological diagnosis of FIP ante-mortem may be difficult, if not impossible. The background of the cat, its history, the clinical signs, laboratory changes, antibody titres and effusion analysis should all be used to help in decision-making about further diagnostic procedures. At the time of writing, there is no non-invasive confirmatory test available for cats without effusion. DISEASE MANAGEMENT: In most cases FIP is fatal. Supportive treatment is aimed at suppressing the inflammatory and detrimental immune response. However, there are no controlled studies to prove any beneficial effect of corticosteroids. VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS: At present, only one (intranasal) FIP vaccine is available, which is considered as being non-core. Kittens may profit from vaccination when they have not been exposed to FCoV (eg, in an early-weaning programme), particularly if they enter a FCoV-endemic environment."

    "abstract": "Although only recently discovered, feline adrenal disorders are becoming increasingly more recognized. Feline adrenal disorders include diseases such as hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's syndrome) and hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome). The clinical signs of feline hyperadrenocorticism, which include unregulated diabetes mellitus and severe skin atrophy, are unique to the cat. Other signs of feline hyperadrenocorticism, such as potbellied appearance, polydipsia, polyuria, and susceptibility to infections are also seen in dogs with hyperadrenocorticism. Conn's syndrome has only recently been described in the cat and is in fact more common in cats than in dogs. Characterized by severe hypokalemia, hypertension, and muscle weakness, Conn's syndrome may be misdiagnosed as renal failure. The clinician should become familiar with the clinical signs of adrenal disorders in cats and the common diagnostic tests used to diagnose these syndromes in cats as they differ from those in the dog. Treatment of feline adrenal disorders may be challenging; the clinician should become familiar with common drugs used to treat adrenal disorders in cats."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that both the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and inferior temporal cortex (ITC) are involved in high-level visual processing and categorization, but their respective roles are not known. To address this, we trained monkeys to categorize a continuous set of visual stimuli into two categories, \"cats\" and \"dogs.\" The stimuli were parametrically generated using a computer graphics morphing system (Sheltonelton, 2000) that allowed precise control over stimulus shape. After training, we recorded neural activity from the PFC and the ITC of monkeys while they performed a category-matching task. We found that the PFC and the ITC play distinct roles in category-based behaviors: the ITC seems more involved in the analysis of currently viewed shapes, whereas the PFC showed stronger category signals, memory effects, and a greater tendency to encode information in terms of its behavioral meaning."

    "abstract": "Previous experiments have demonstrated that cats fed an arginine free purified amino acid diet (-Arg) could be protected from hyperammonemia by the inclusion of ornithine in the diet. Experiments reported here show that diets containing ornithine added at an equimolar (+Orn) or five times equimolar (+5 Orn) to replace arginine in the +Arg basal diet (2.0% Arg . HCl), were incapable of maintenance of body weight. Growing kittens fed a -Arg +Orn and -Arg +5 Orn diets had a daily rate of body weight loss of 6.5 +/- 0.6 and 7.9 +/- 2.2 g, respectively, which is somewhat less than the mean rate of weight loss of kittens fed diets devoid of most of the other amino acids indispensable for the kitten. When citrulline was added to a -Arg diet at an equimolar level to the arginine in the +Arg basal diet, growth rates were equivalent. The mean plasma free ornithine concentration of kittens receiving the -Arg +5 Orn diet was about 33 times higher than when they were fed the +Arg diet. For kittens fed the -Arg + Orn and -Arg +5 Orn diets the mean plasma free arginine was less (but significant only for the -Arg + Orn diet) than that observed for the basal diet. When the -Arg + Cit diet was fed, plasma free arginine concentration was similar and plasma free citrulline was about 18 times higher than when these cats were fed the basal diet."

    "abstract": "This paper reports five new cases of intrathoracic tracheal rupture in cats, and summarizes these cases in conjunction with 11 cases from the literature. Most cats had no obvious respiratory signs at the time of injury, and in half of them the tracheal rupture was the only injury. The interval from trauma to onset of dyspnoea ranged from 1 to 28 days (median 12.5 days). Radiographic findings include loss of continuity of the trachea, often with a gas-filled diverticulum present between separated tracheal rings. With careful attention to surgical technique and anaesthetic management the prognosis for these cats is excellent. All eight of the cats reported in the last 14 years having surgical correction survived and returned to normal. The surgical anatomy, approach and tracheal anastomosis technique is described and recommendations for anaesthetic management are made."

    "abstract": "Insulated metal polarographic cathodes were permanently implanted in the brains of cats, allowing continuous recording of oxygen availability. A study was made of the current flow as related to applied potential, nature of the cathode and alterations in brain physiology. Mean oxygen availability increases about 2-fold on breathing oxygen, 3-fold on breathing air containing 14% carbon dioxide and decreases with hypoxic gas mixtures. The oxygen availability to the brain is only slightly altered by a wide variety of pharmacological agents, including anesthetics and pressor agents, but appears to parallel changes in carbon dioxide tension and to be increased by ethyl and vinyl ether. A day or two after implantation of a cathode, waves having a frequency of 6-12/min. and an amplitude of up to {+/-}30% of the mean current are obtained. Their frequency and amplitude are temperature-dependent and can be altered by various chemical agents. The waves are asynchronous from cathodes spaced farther apart than a few millimeters. All the observations to date are consistent with the concept that these waves represent fluctuations in the amount of oxygen available at the cathode due to rhythmic variations in blood flow through the finer cerebral vessels."

    "abstract": "Intestinal tissue samples were examined from 32 cats in which a histopathological diagnosis of alimentary lymphoma or multicentric lymphoma affecting the gastrointestinal tract had been made. These samples were re-evaluated histopathologically and serial sections were examined immunohistochemically with antisera specific for the lymphoid markers CD3, CD79a and BLA-36 and for class II molecules of the major histocompatability complex. The cats ranged in age from 4-16 years (median 10.5 years). The main presenting clinical signs were vomiting, diarrhoea and weight loss. The majority of alimentary lymphomas were of the B-cell type (n=15), whereas cases of T-cell lymphoma were fewer in number (n=8). Four cats had lymphoma of a mixed T-and B-cell phenotype. In five of the cats, immunohistochemistry suggested an inflammatory process, in contradiction to the original histopathological diagnosis of lymphoma. Immunolabelling would appear to be a useful adjunct to histopathology in classifying cases of feline alimentary lymphoma, and may help in distinguishing lymphoma from severe intestinal inflammation."

An association with human neuropsychiatric diseases has been reported, but the causal relationship between BDV and human disease remains unclear. Objectives and study design: To find out whether BDV is present in Finland and to look for a potential reservoir, we examined a large panel of blood samples from different vertebrate species with immunofluorescence assay. Samples from horses, cats, dogs, sheep, cattle, large predators, grouse, wild rodents and humans were included. Most positive results were confirmed by other specific methods and in other laboratories. Results and conclusions: BDV-specific antibodies were detected in 10 horses, 2 cats, as well as 2 horses and 1 dog from farms housing a previously detected seropositive horse. Interestingly, BDV-specific antibodies were further detected in three wild rodents. In humans, BDV- specific antibodies were detected in a veterinarian and in two patients suspected to have a Puumala hantavirus infection. Our serological analysis suggests that BDV infects various vertebrates in Finland, including humans. Furthermore, our data indicate for the first time that BDV infects also wild rodents."

A stimulation method that improves activation of the urethra-bladder excitatory reflex with minimal sphincter recruitment may lead to improved bladder emptying. Fine wire electrodes were placed in the wall of the urethra in five cats. Placement of electrodes near the proximal urethra evoked bladder contractions with minimal sphincter activation. On these electrodes, lower frequency burst-patterned stimuli evoked greater bladder voiding efficiencies (71.2 +/- 27.8%) than other stimulus patterns on the same electrodes (50.4 +/- 41.5%, p > 0.05) or any stimulus pattern on electrodes that elicited urethral closure (16.5 +/- 12.7%, p < 0.05). Fine wire electrodes specifically targeted afferent fibers in the urethra, indicating the feasibility of clinical evaluations using the same method. This work may improve the translation of next generation neuroprostheses for bladder control."

In Experiment 1, we examined the effectiveness of oral grooming in removing fleas which are the main ectoparasite of cats. Elizabethan collars Ž. E-collars which prevented grooming were fitted on nine cats in a flea-infested household and 3 weeks later, flea numbers on these cats were compared with nine control cats in the same household. Flea numbers dropped in the control cats reflecting an apparent drop in adult fleas in the environment, but in the E-collar cats, flea numbers did not drop, and were about twice as numerous as in control cats. The significantly greater number of fleas on the E-collar cats was attributed to their inability to groom off fleas. In Experiment 2, videotaping of nine different cats from the flea-infested household revealed that these cats groomed at about twice the rate of 10 similarly videotaped control cats from a flea-free colony. These results reveal that flea exposure can increase grooming rate in cats and that grooming is effective in removing fleas. q"

    "abstract": "A cross-sectional questionnaire study of cat owners registered with a first opinion veterinary practice was undertaken in July 2008. The body condition score (BCS) of the cats was assessed by the interviewer using a validated five point scale. Owners also rated their cat's BCS using five word descriptions. In total, 118 questionnaires were collected. The prevalence of overweight or obese cats (BCS 4 or 5) was 39% (30.2-47.8%, n=61). Risk factors associated with overweight or obesity were frequency of feeding and neutered status. There was moderate agreement between owner and interviewer rating of BCS. Owner misperception was more likely when owners rated cats with BCS 1 (very thin) and 4 (overweight) and in longhaired cats. The study highlights the continuing need for owner education in feline nutrition and specifically the requirement for veterinarians to develop strategies to help owners correct their assessment of their cat's BCS."

    "abstract": "The pharmacokinetics, biodisposition, and neuromuscular blocking properties of 3-desacetylvecuronium were studied in 17 adult cats. Animals were divided into three groups: five cats with kidney failure induced by bilateral ligation of the renal pedicles, six cats with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatitis, and six control cats. An intravenous bolus of 300 micrograms.kg-1 of 3-desacetylvecuronium was rapidly injected into the jugular vein. Arterial blood, urine, and bile samples were collected at regular intervals for 6 h in control cats and for 8 h in cats with kidney or liver failure. The liver was excised for analysis at the end of the experiment. In cats with renal failure, 3-desacetylvecuronium pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables did not differ from those in control cats. In cats with liver failure, plasma clearance was significantly less and mean residence time greater than in control cats (2.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.1 +/- 6.5 ml.kg-1.min-1 and 334 +/- 225 vs. 49 +/- 29 min, mean +/- SD, respectively). Volume of distribution at steady state in cats with liver failure and in control cats was not different. Also, in cats with liver failure, the duration of action and recovery index of 3-desacetylvecuronium was significantly greater than in control cats (168 +/- 62 vs. 82 +/- 32 min, and 39 +/- 19 vs. 10 +/- 4 min, respectively). Onset time of neuromuscular blockade was similar in all three groups. Total recovery of 3-desacetylvecuronium, for all three groups, in urine, bile, and liver was 90 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD). In control cats, 70 +/- 18% of 3-desacetylvecuronium was recovered in bile and liver and 19 +/- 14% in urine. No 3,17-bidesacetylvecuronium (a putative 3-desacetylvecuronium metabolite) was detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "The authors induced experimental hydrothorax in cats by injecting dextran into the pleural cavity under brief N2O anaesthesia. They examined the parameters of cough -- elicited by mechanical stimulation of the airway mucosa -- and blood gas and pH values under normal conditions and after the injection of 50, 100, 200 and 250 ml dextran. The tests were always performed 30 min after terminating anaesthesia, i.e. in conscious animals. The free fluid in the thorax was found, in conscious cats, to reduce the inspiratory values of cough, but to have no effect on cough expiration. This is in agreement with previous findings showing that the intensity of a cough expiration does not always depend on the intensity of the preceding cough inspiration. According to this finding, the decrease in the expiratory values of cough observed during experimental pleurisy cannot be due to the actual exudate. In cats, experimental hydrothorax in doses of 200 and 250 ml leads to respiratory insufficiency. The authors further found that, for the study of interoception in the airways of conscious cats, which requires experimental induction of pathological conditions under brief anaesthesia, nitrous oxide is a convenient anesthetic."

    "abstract": "Interlimb coordination is directly relevant to the understanding of the neural control of locomotion, but few studies addressing this topic for nonhuman primates are available, and no data exist for any hominoid other than humans. As a follow-up to Jungers and Anapol's ([1985] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 67:89-97) analysis on a lemur and talapoin monkey, we describe here the patterns of interlimb coordination in two chimpanzees as revealed by electromyography. Like the lemur and talapoin monkey, ipsilateral limb coupling in chimpanzees is characterized by variability about preferred modes within individual gaits. During symmetrical gaits, limb coupling patterns in the chimpanzee are also influenced by kinematic differences in hindlimb placement (\"overstriding\"). These observations reflect the neurological constraints placed on locomotion but also emphasize the overall flexibility of locomotor neural mechanisms. Interlimb coordination patterns are also species-specific, exhibiting significant differences among primate taxa and between primates and cats. Interspecific differences may be suggestive of phylogenetic divergence in the basic mechanisms for neural control of locomotion, but do not preclude morphological explanations for observed differences in interlimb coordination across species."

    "abstract": "Computer simulations are being used increasingly to gain an understanding of the complex interactions between the neuronal, sensory, muscular and mechanical components of locomotor systems. Recent neuro-mechanical simulations of walking in humans, cats and insects, and of swimming in lampreys, have provided new information on the functional role of specific groups of sensory receptors in regulating locomotion. As we discuss in this review, these studies also make it clear that a full understanding of the neural and mechanical mechanisms that underlie locomotion can be achieved only by using simulations in parallel with physiological investigations. The widespread implementation of this approach would be enhanced by the development of freely available and easy-to-use software tools."

    "abstract": "Limited information is available on the utilization of different types of diets by captive exotic felid species. Utilization of diets by small exotic felids may differ depending on the diet fed. Eight sand cats ( Felis margarita) , which are small, 2- to 4-kg cats, were used to examine the digestibility of two types of diets: a raw meat-based diet and a dry kibble diet. Dry matter, crude protein and energy intakes and digestibilities were evaluated. Digestibilities for dry matter, energy, and crude protein were 83.5 ± 4.8, 89.6 ± 5.2, 92.4 ± 5.3% for the raw meat-based diet and 72.7 ± 12.3, 76.8 ± 14.5, and 77.9 ± 13.5% for the kibble diet. Physiological variables also were examined and included plasma taurine, vitamin A, retinyl palmitate, b-carotene, calcium, and phosphorus. Plasma taurine means were 91.4 ± 8.4 mmol/L in cats consuming the raw meat-based diet and 248.0 ± 23.2 mmol/L in cats consuming the kibble diet. Plasma phosphorus was 5.2 ± .1 and 4.5 ± .1 mg/dL, respectively, in cats consuming raw meat-based and kibble diets. b-Carotene was 25.2 ± 2.9 and 2.9 ± .3 mg/dL, respectively, for cats consuming the raw meatbased and kibble diets. These results indicate that diets formulated for small captive exotic felid species should be evaluated with respect to diet type and nutrient utilization."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the copper requirement of female cats (queens) for gestation. Cuproenzyme activities were evaluated to identify a noninvasive indicator of copper status. This study used a depletion-repletion model. Specific pathogen–free queens (n = 28) were adapted to a purified diet; after consuming a copper-depletion diet (0.8 mg Cu/kg diet) for 4 mo, they were randomly allocated to three dietary treatment groups receiving copper sulfate at 4.0, 5.8 or 10.8 mg Cu/kg diet. Four queens underwent liver biopsies at two time points during the study. Plasma samples were analyzed for copper concentrations, extracellular superoxide dismutase, ceruloplasmin and diamine oxidase activities. Only liver copper concentrations were responsive to dietary copper intake. The dietary concentration of copper had a significant effect on the time taken for queens to conceive (P = 0.04). There was a negative linear relationship between dietary copper (x = Cu mg/kg diet) and the mean time (y = days) for queens to conceive (y = 43.38 - 2.87x; R2 = 0.97). The current NRC recommendation of 5 mg/kg diet copper for cats appears marginal for optimal reproduction."

    "abstract": "Objective-To determine the time and financial costs of programs for live trapping feral cats and determine whether allowing cats to become acclimated to the traps improved trapping effectiveness.Design-Prospective cohort study. Animals-107 feral cats in 9 colonies.Procedure-15 traps were set at each colony for 5 consecutive nights, and 5 traps were then set per night until trapping was complete. In 4 colonies, traps were immediately baited and set; in the remaining 5 colonies, traps were left open and cats were fed in the traps for 3 days prior to the initiation of trapping. Costs for bait and labor were calculated, and trapping effort and efficiency were assessed.Results-Mean +/- SD overall trapping effort (ie, number of trap-nights until at least 90% of the cats in the colony had been captured or until no more than 1 cat remained untrapped) was 8.9 +/- 3.9 trap-nights per cat captured. Mean overall trapping efficiency (ie, percentage of cats captured per colony) was 98.0 +/- 4.0%. There were no significant differences in trapping effort or efficiency between colonies that were provided an acclimation period and colonies that were not. Overall trapping costs were significantly higher for colonies provided an acclimation period.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggest that these live-trapping protocols were effective. Feeding cats their regular diets in the traps for 3 days prior to the initiation of trapping did not have a significant effect on trapping effort or efficiency in the present study but was associated with significant increases in trapping costs."

    "abstract": "It has been estimated that from 100 million to well over 1 billion birds are killed annually in the United States due to collisions with human-made structures, including vehicles, buildings and windows, powerlines, communication towers, and wind turbines. Although wind energy is generally considered environmentally friendly (because it generates electricity without emitting air pollutants or greenhouse gases), the potential for avian fatalities has delayed and even significantly contributed to blocking the development of some windplants in the U.S. Given the importance of developing a viable renewable source of energy, the objective of this paper is to put the issue of avian mortality associated with windpower into perspective with other sources of avian collision mortality across the U.S. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed summary of the mortality data collected at windplants and put avian collision mortality associated with windpower development into perspective with other significant sources of avian collision mortality across the United States. We provide a summary of data collected at many of the U.S. windplants and provide annual bird fatality estimates and projections for all wind turbines in the U.S. For comparison, we also review studies of avian collision mortality from other major human-made structures and report annual bird fatality estimates for these sources. Other sources also significantly contribute to overall avian mortality. For example, the National Audubon Society estimates avian mortality due to house cats at 100 million birds per year. Pesticide use, oil spills, disease, etc., are other significant sources of unintended avian mortality. Due to funding constraints, the scope of this paper is limited to examining only avian mortality resulting from collisions with human-made obstacles."

    "abstract": "Flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) is considered a harmful and persistent allergic disease in cats, dogs and humans. Effective and safe antigen-specific treatments are lacking. Previously we reported that the simultaneous co-immunization with a DNA vaccine and its cognate coded protein antigen could induce antigen-specific iTreg cells (inducible Treg cells); demonstrating its potential to protect animals from FAD in a murine model. Its clinical efficacy however, remains to be demonstrated. In this report, we clinically tested this protocol to treat established FAD in cats following flea infestations. We present data showing a profound therapeutic improvement of dermatitis in these FAD cats following two co-immunizations, not only in relieving clinical symptoms, but also the amelioration of the allergic responses, including antigen-induced wheal formation, elevated T cell proliferation, infiltration of lymphocytes and migration of mast cells to the sites. This study demonstrates that a co-immunization approach as described can be used to treat flea-induced allergic disease in animals, thus implicating its potential for a practical clinical application."

    "abstract": "Objective—To evaluate the accuracy of endoscopic biopsy (EB) specimens for diagnosis of alimentary tract lymphosarcoma in cats. Design—Prospective study. Animals—22 cats with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or alimentary tract lymphosarcoma. Procedures—Endoscopic biopsy specimens were obtained during endoscopy of the stomach and duo- denum immediately prior to laparotomy or laparo- scopic surgery, during which full-thickness biopsy (FTB) specimens were obtained. Accuracy of histopathologic diagnoses was compared between EB and FTB specimens. Results—Lymphosarcoma was diagnosed in 10 cats on the basis of FTB specimens. Lymphosarcoma was detected in the jejunum and ileum in all 10 cats, in the duodenum in 9 cats, and in the stomach in 4 cats. In the same 10 cats, EB findings indicated a diagnosis of lymphosarcoma in 3 cats and were suggestive but inconclusive for lymphosarcoma in 3 cats. Lymphosarcoma was correctly diagnosed via gastric EB specimens in 3 of the 4 cats with gastric lym- phosarcoma but evaluation of EB specimens led to an incorrect diagnosis of IBD in 4 cats with small intesti- nal lymphosarcoma. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—EB specimens were useful for diagnosis of gastric lymphosarcoma but were not adequate for differentiating between IBD and lymphosarcoma in the small intestine. Because the most common sites of alimentary tract lymphosarcoma in cats are the jejunum and ileum, FTB specimens of those sites should be obtained via laparotomy or laparoscopy for accurate diagnosis. Laparoscopy may be a minimally invasive alternative to endoscopy and laparo- tomy for obtaining diagnostic biopsy specimens. (J Am Vet Med Assoc 2006;229:1447–1450)"

Radiographic changes were noted in 24 cats, which included increased bronchial (n = 5), interstitial (n = 7) and mixed (n = 12) (bronchial and interstitial) patterns. Right middle lung lobe collapse was noted in two cats. Abnormal bronchial cytology was present in 16 cats. A predominant eosinophilic sample was collected in only three cats. There were minimal changes in differential white cell counts, and mild eosinophilia was found in only five cats. Prednisolone alone was the most effective therapy, although avoidance of putative aeroallergens and antibacterial therapy was effective in some. On the basis of the data from these cases it would appear that the diagnosis of FAS depends largely on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings. The value of ancillary tests in the diagnosis of FAS appears to be limited."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Targeted research development in veterinary homeopathy is properly informed by the systematic collection and analysis of relevant clinical data obtained by its practitioners. We organised a pilot data collection study, in which 8 Faculty of Homeopathy veterinarians collected practice-based clinical and outcomes data over a 6-month period. METHODS: A specifically designed Excel spreadsheet enabled recording of consecutive clinical appointments under the following headings: date; identity of patient and owner (anonymised); age, sex and species of patient; medical condition/complaint treated; whether confirmed diagnosis, chronic or acute, new or follow-up case; owner-assessed outcome (7-point Likert scale: -3 to +3) compared with first appointment; homeopathic medicine/s prescribed; other medication/s for the condition/complaint. Spreadsheets were submitted monthly by e-mail to the project organisers for data checking, synthesis and analysis. RESULTS: Practitioners submitted data regularly and punctually, and most data cells were completed. 767 individual patients were treated (547 dogs, 155 cats, 50 horses, 5 rabbits, 4 guinea-pigs, 2 birds, 2 goats, 1 cow, and 1 tortoise). Outcome from two or more homeopathic appointments per patient condition was obtained in 539 cases (79.8% showing improvement, 6.1% deterioration, 11.7% no change; outcome not recorded in 2.4% of follow-ups). Strongly positive outcomes (scores of +2 or +3) were achieved in: arthritis and epilepsy in dogs and, in smaller numbers, in atopic dermatitis, gingivitis and hyperthyroidism in cats. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic recording of data by veterinarians in clinical practice is feasible and capable of informing future research in veterinary homeopathy. A refined version of the spreadsheet can be used in larger-scale research-targeted veterinary data collection."

We modeled the feedforward excitatory and inhibitory inputs to these cells based on in vivo recordings in cats, and we found that the reliability of spike transmission increased steeply between 20 and 40 synchronous thalamic inputs in a time window of 5 milliseconds, when the reliability per spike was most energetically efficient. The optimal range of synchronous inputs was influenced by the balance of background excitation and inhibition in the cortex, which could gate the flow of information into the cortex. Ensuring reliable transmission by spike synchrony in small populations of neurons may be a general principle of cortical function."

Many advances in control of fleas can be directly linked to improved knowledge of the intricacies of flea host associations, reproduction, and survival in the premises. Understanding tick biology and ecology is far more difficult than with fleas, because North America can have up to 9 different tick species infesting cats and dogs compared to 1 primary flea species. Effective tick control is more difficult to achieve than effective flea control, because of the abundance of potential alternative hosts in the tick life cycle. Many effective host-targeted tick control agents exist, several of which also possess activity against adult or immature fleas and other parasites. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Time-frequency analyses of the heart period variability power spectrum in the high frequency region (0.12-0.4 Hz), reflecting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), were carried out during 5 minutes in each condition. The main finding showed that RSA-magnitude (high frequency power) was inversely related to emotional valence: lowest magnitudes were found in response to positive films, and highest magnitude to negative films.

    "abstract": "During wakefulness, neocortical neurons are subjected to an intense synaptic bombardment. To assess the consequences of this background activity for the integrative properties of pyramidal neurons, we constrained biophysical models with in vivo intracellular data obtained in anesthetized cats during periods of intense network activity similar to that observed in the waking state. In pyramidal cells of the parietal cortex (area 5-7), synaptic activity was responsible for an approximately fivefold decrease in input resistance (Rin), a more depolarized membrane potential (Vm), and a marked increase in the amplitude of Vm fluctuations, as determined by comparing the same cells before and after microperfusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX). The model was constrained by measurements of Rin, by the average value and standard deviation of the Vm measured from epochs of intense synaptic activity recorded with KAc or KCl-filled pipettes as well as the values measured in the same cells after TTX. To reproduce all experimental results, the simulated synaptic activity had to be of relatively high frequency (1-5 Hz) at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In addition, synaptic inputs had to be significantly correlated (correlation coefficient approximately 0.1) to reproduce the amplitude of Vm fluctuations recorded experimentally. The presence of voltage-dependent K+ currents, estimated from current-voltage relations after TTX, affected these parameters by <10%. The model predicts that the conductance due to synaptic activity is 7-30 times larger than the somatic leak conductance to be consistent with the approximately fivefold change in Rin. The impact of this massive increase in conductance on dendritic attenuation was investigated for passive neurons and neurons with voltage-dependent Na+/K+ currents in soma and dendrites. In passive neurons, correlated synaptic bombardment had a major influence on dendritic attenuation. The electrotonic attenuation of simulated synaptic inputs was enhanced greatly in the presence of synaptic bombardment, with distal synapses having minimal effects at the soma. Similarly, in the presence of dendritic voltage-dependent currents, the convergence of hundreds of synaptic inputs was required to evoke action potentials reliably. In this case, however, dendritic voltage-dependent currents minimized the variability due to input location, with distal apical synapses being as effective as synapses on basal dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of intracellular and computational data suggests that, during low-amplitude fast electroencephalographic activity, neocortical neurons are bombarded continuously by correlated synaptic inputs at high frequency, which significantly affect their integrative properties. A series of predictions are suggested to test this model."

In the acute cats, DN (1-3 mg/kg, i.v.) produced 8-10 Hz waves in the hypothalamus lateralis and amygdala, and the hippocampal arousal wave gave way to the irregular high amplitude slow waves. In the midbrain reticular formation, nucl. reticularis and cortex, 12-13 Hz waves and high amplitude slow waves increased. A sleep-like pattern with spindle burst-like waves formed the general pattern of all EEGs. These spontaneous EEG activities were significantly inhibited by epinephrine hydrochloride and were potentiated by tolazoline hydrochloride and dibenamine hydrochloride etc. The above EEG changes were obtained even in the spinal cats. DN depressed the EEG arousal response produced by high frequency stimulation of the sciatic nerve and increased the threshold of stimulation. In the chronic cats, DN (1 mg/kg, i.v.) produced spindle burst-like waves of 12-14 Hz in the cortex and sedation concomitantly. These findings suggest that DN has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system and that adrenergic neurons are probably involved."

Previously, we found marked differences in average daily \"duty time\" (i.e., the percentage of total sampling time filled with EMG activity) between different muscles, or muscle portions. We have now analyzed systematic differences in duty time between (i) highly active (midday) and relatively inactive (midnight) periods, and (ii) individual cats. Differences between cats seemed to be associated with differences in motor habits. The midnight reduction in activity was particularly striking for muscles with a high midday activity. Quantitative differences in spontaneous activity (duty time), as compared between active and inactive periods of the day or among individual cats, were associated with marked qualitative alterations in the distribution of activity among the sampled muscles, i.e., these quantitative differences could not be described as a simple up- or downscaling of general motor activity"

    "abstract": "The changes in laryngeal resistance (LR) during respiratory arrest produced by withdrawal of hypoxia stimulation and administration of various respiratory depressants were studied in 14 spontaneously breathing, anesthetized cats (11 cats with alpha-chloralose and three cats with halothane). Withdrawal of hypoxia stimulation caused a transient respiratory arrest with no central inspiratory activity, during which a considerable increase in LR was observed to a level higher than the fixed resistance after muscle paralysis [LR(fix)]. Intravenous injection of thiopentone, ketamine, and lidocaine all caused a transient respiratory arrest. However, the effects on the laryngeal function and the central inspiratory activity were different for each agent. Both thiopentone and ketamine induced an inspiratory apneusis pattern in phrenic nerve discharge, and lidocaine caused a silence of phrenic nerve activity. Thiopentone relaxed the larynx, and LR during thiopentone-induced respiratory arrest was almost equal to LR(fix). Ketamine maintained a dilatation of the larynx, and LR during ketamine-induced respiratory arrest was lower than LR(fix). Lidocaine caused a constriction of the larynx and LR greatly increased, leading frequently to laryngospasm. These results indicate that hypoxia withdrawal, thiopentone, ketamine, and lidocaine all cause different effects on the central inspiratory activity, and that the central respiratory depression produced by these methods is not accompanied by a uniform depression of laryngeal function."

    "abstract": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) contributes to the development of hypertension in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and animal models. However, the early cardiovascular changes that precede CIH-induced hypertension are not completely understood. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that one of the possible contributing mechanisms to CIH-induced hypertension is a potentiation of carotid body (CB) hypoxic chemoreflexes. Therefore, we studied the dynamic responses of heart rate, blood pressure, and their variabilities during acute exposure to different levels of hypoxia after CIH short-term preconditioning (4 days) in cats. In addition, we measured baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) on the control of heart rate by noninvasive techniques. To assess the relationships among these indexes and CB chemoreflexes, we also recorded CB chemosensory discharges. Our data show that short-term CIH reduced BRS, potentiated the increase in heart rate induced by acute hypoxia, and was associated with a dynamic shift of heart rate variability (HRV) spectral indexes toward the low-frequency band. In addition, we found a striking linear correlation (r = 0.97) between the low-to-high frequency ratio of HRV and baseline. CB chemosensory discharges in the CIH-treated cats. Thus, our results suggest that cyclic hypoxic stimulation of the CB by short-term CIH induces subtle but clear selective alterations of HRV and BRS in normotensive cats."

    "abstract": "Snider 's pioneering studies of tactile responses in the cerebellar cortex of cats and monkeys suggested that posterior regions of the cerebellar hemispheres receive somatotopically organized projections. However, recent studies in rats, using high-density, in depth microelectrode mapping methods, have shown that tactile projections to the granule cell layer of the cerebellar hemispheres are somatotopically disrupted. We reexamined the organization of cutaneous projections to cerebellar hemispheric cortex in cats by using micromapping methods. Natural stimulation of cutaneous surfaces evokes short-latency (mossy-fiber-induced) multiple unit responses in the cerebellar granule cell layer of crus II and paramedian lobule in both ketamine- and barbiturate-anesthetized cats. Facial structures are represented in several of the most caudomedial folia of crus II as well as in three of the rostral folia of the paramedian lobule. In several of these paramedian folia, facial projections are interspersed with projections from the forelimb. Forelimb structures alone are represented in two intermediate folia of the paramedian lobule. No cutaneous projections were found from the trunk or hindlimb. All projections were from ipsilateral receptive fields. In four folia of crus II and six folia of the paramedian lobule, cutaneous projections form a mosaic of patchlike projections. Within single patches, projections are somatotopically organized, but projections to adjacent patches come from noncontiguous body regions. Within a single folium , a particular facial region may be represented in two or three spatially separated patches. Facial patches are small, usually less than 1 mm2. Forelimb patches are usually larger, often extending the full length and breadth of a folial crown. Patches with like receptive fields are not organized in zonal sagittal strips. Rather than being somatotopically organized, cutaneous mossy fiber projections to granule cells in cats, as in rats, reveal a more complex mosaic pattern of organization."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the natural history of primary pulmonic infundibular stenosis in cats and the effects of balloon valvuloplasty. BACKGROUND: Primary pulmonic infundibular stenosis is an uncommon congenital defect in cats. The natural history of the disease has not been described. Information regarding balloon valvuloplasty in the cat is limited. ANIMALS: Records between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2005 were reviewed and cats with a confirmed echocardiographic diagnosis of primary pulmonic infundibular stenosis, a complete medical history, and no evidence of significant systemic disease were identified. METHODS: Echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and radiographic findings are described. The natural history of those with severe disease was compared to those with mild to moderate disease. Balloon valvuloplasty was performed in six of the cats. The technique used is described. RESULTS: A stenotic gradient >or=70 mmHg and a right ventricular outflow tract (measured at the level of the stenosis) to pulmonary valve annulus ratio of <or=0.25 were consistent with clinical and echocardiographic severe disease. Cats with severe disease had a very guarded prognosis with a high incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Balloon valvuloplasty was successfully performed in 4 of the cats and appeared to improve prognosis, especially if performed prior to the development of CHF. Concurrent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy complicated the outcome in some cats. CONCLUSIONS: Severe primary pulmonic infundibular stenosis carries a very guarded prognosis in the cat. Balloon valvuloplasty should be considered in the presence of severe disease and should be performed prior to the development of CHF if possible. The presence of concurrent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may complicate the prognosis."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal lymphomas were identified in 120 cats between 1995 and 2006. Lymphomas were classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) scheme. Cats with mucosal T-cell lymphoma (n = 84) predominated and had a median survival of 29 months. Mucosal T-cell lymphoma matched WHO enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATCL) type II. Epitheliotropic T-cell infiltrates were present in 62% of cats and occurred as clusters or diffuse infiltrates of small to intermediate-sized T cells in villous and/or crypt epithelium. Similar lymphocytes infiltrated the lamina propria in distinctive patterns. Cats with transmural T-cell lymphoma (n = 19) had a median survival of 1.5 months. Transmural T-cell lymphoma matched WHO EATCL type I. Epitheliotropic T-cell infiltrates were present in 58% of cats. Large lymphocytes (n = 11), mostly with cytoplasmic granules (LGL-granzyme B+) (n = 9) predominated. Transmural extension across the muscularis propria characterized the lesion. Both mucosal and transmural T-cell lymphomas were largely confined to the small intestine, and molecular clonality analysis revealed clonal or oligoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor-γ in 90% of cats. Cats with B-cell lymphoma (n = 19) had a median survival of 3.5 months. B-cell lymphomas occurred as transmural lesions in stomach, jejunum, and ileo-cecal-colic junction. The majority were diffuse, large B-cell lymphomas of centroblastic type. In conclusion, T-cell lymphomas characterized by distinctive mucosal architecture, CD3 expression, and clonal expansion predominated in the feline gastrointestinal tract."

    "abstract": "Cranial mediastinal lesions were detected in three cats, associated with respiratory impairment (case one), spontaneous pneumothorax (case two) and myasthenia gravis (case three), respectively. On gross and histological examination, the first case was considered either a lymphangioma or a branchial cystic mass of the thymic region of the mediastinum; a cystic lesion was suggested by sonographic detection of multiple anechoic cavitations within a circumscribed mass, while fine needle aspiration cytology excluded lymphosarcoma. The second case was diagnosed histologically as a cystic thymoma, but the third case was not examined microscopically. The masses were amenable to surgical excision in the first two cats, while this proved unnecessary in the third case because of resolution following treatment with dexamethasone. Corticosteroid responsiveness was unhelpful in distinguishing between these benign lesions and lymphosarcoma, as in two cases there was a partial or complete response to dosing with prednisolone or dexamethasone. These cases are presented to emphasise that conditions other than lymphosarcoma can produce cranial mediastinal lesions in cats, and that the prognosis for surgical treatment of lymphangiomas, multilocular thymic cysts and cystic thymomas can be excellent."

The subjects were 4,813 cats and 3,301 dogs impounded by the Sacramento County Department of Animal Care and Regulation and offered for adoption September 9, 1994 to May 26, 1995. The study constructed models predicting the conditional probability of adoption using logistic regression and a final multiple logistic regression model from variables found to be important predictors of adoption. Age, sex, coat color, and reason for relinquishment were major determinants of adoption in cats. Age, sex, coat color, reason for relinquishment, breed, purebred status, and injury status were major determinants of adoption in dogs. Shelter personnel could utilize this information to increase the adoption of frequently overlooked animals. Alternatively, shelters could use this to focus their resources on animals with characteristics the public prefers."

Somehow, the brain uses limited variable examples to extract the essential characteristics of new visual categories. Here, I describe an approach to category learning and recognition that is based on recent computational advances. In this approach, objects are represented by a hierarchy of fragments that are extracted during learning from observed examples. The fragments are class-specific features and are selected to deliver a high amount of information for categorization. The same fragments hierarchy is then used for general categorization, individual object recognition and object-parts identification. Recognition is also combined with object segmentation, using stored fragments, to provide a top-down process that delineates object boundaries in complex cluttered scenes. The approach is computationally effective and provides a possible framework for categorization, recognition and segmentation in human vision."

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that rodent brains can be used as representative models of neurochemical function in other species, such as humans. We have compared the distributions of the predominant glial glutamate transporters in rodents, rabbits, cats, pigs, monkeys, and humans. We identify similarities but also significant differences between species. GLT-1v, which is abundantly expressed by rodent astrocytes, is expressed only in a rare subset of astrocytes of cats and humans, and appears to be absent from brains of rabbits and monkeys. Conversely, in the pig brain GLT-1v is expressed only by oligodendrocytes. GLAST and GLT-1alpha expression differed significantly between species; while rodents and rabbits exhibited uniform expression patterns in cortex, higher species, including cats, pigs, monkeys, and humans, exhibited heterogeneities in cortical and hippocampal expression. Patches devoid of labeling intermingling with patches of strong labeling were evident in areas such as temporal cortex and frontal cortex. In addition, we noted that in human motor cortex, there were inconsistencies in labeling for the C-terminal of GLT-1alpha and common domains of GLT-1, suggesting that the C-terminal region may be missing or that an unidentified splicing is present in many human astrocytes. Collectively our data suggest that assumptions as to the roles of glutamate transporters in any species may need to be tested empirically."

    "abstract": "The objectives of this paper are to review published data on the prevalence and epidemiology of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and colonization in animals and to provide suggestions for preventing and controlling the problem in veterinary practice. MRSA first emerged as a serious pathogen in human medicine during the late 1970s and has been increasingly reported in animals during the past 10 years. The prevalence of MRSA in human infections varies markedly between geographical areas, being as high as 60% in parts of the USA, 40% in southern Europe but <1% in northern Europe. Epidemiological evidence, including phenotypic and molecular typing data, suggests that MRSA isolates from dogs and cats are indistinguishable from human healthcare isolates, whereas strains of MRSA isolated from horses and associated personnel are different. There is evidence that transfer of MRSA strains can occur between animals and humans and vice versa. Guidelines for the control of MRSA in animals have been drawn up by individual institutions based on those available for human MRSA infection. Risk factors for MRSA infection in animals are currently under investigation and such data are essential for the preparation of specific guidelines for control of MRSA in veterinary practice."

    "abstract": "The present study employs simultaneous multielectrode recording techniques to study the feline primary auditory cortex (AI) to characterize its functional architecture. High electrode-count microelectrode arrays provide a high spatial and temporal view of AI, but at the potential cost of significant cortical insult. However, the number of electrodes that record single- and multiunit action potentials shown in this study suggest that the implantation of high electrode-count microelectrode arrays allows for reliable recordings from the cortex and that the neurons abutting the electrode tips appear to be spared from significant insult. Using these recordings, we have constructed a functional model of AI that best specifies the distribution of characteristic frequencies (CF's), and have reaffirmed that CF is logarithmically distributed across the cortical surface with a principal CF axis perpendicular to generally straight isofrequency contours. In four cats, we found that the average CF gradient was 0.53 +/- 0.08 octave per millimeter. This study demonstrates the use of high electrode count, microelectrode array recordings in characterizing the spatial distribution of acoustic information in the feline AI."

    "abstract": "Nineteen domestic cats were entrained to a 12-hr light/12-hr dark lighting cycle and killed at different times of the cycle. The numbers of rod and cone phagosomes in the retinal epithelium (RPE) were quantified by light microscopy. The number of both rod and cone phagosomes shows a large increase within 2 hrs after light onset. Thereafter, the phagosome count remains low until the latter part of the dark period when the number of rod and cone phagosomes increases slightly. In a few cases, substantial variability in phagosome numbers was found between animals killed at the same times in the lighting cycle. Small (0.4-0.8 ??m), dense, membrane-bound granules, that have the ultrastructural features of lysosomes, occur in large numbers in the tapetal RPE cells. The granules may contain only a homogeneous matrix or matrix plus membrane fragments or melanin. Variations in the number of such granules in different animals show no clear diurnal pattern. Phagosome number, size, and length measurements of outer segments are used to provide esimates of cone outer segment turnover time in the cat."

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of dietary fat and energy density on body weight gain, body composi- tion, and total energy expenditure (TEE) in neutered and sexually intact cats. Animals12 male and 12 female cats ProcedureMale cats were castrated (castrated male [CM]) or underwent no surgical procedure (sex- ually intact male [IM]). Female cats underwent ovariectomy (spayed female [SF]) or laparotomy and ligation of both uterine tubes without ovary removal (sexually intact female [IF]). Cats were fed either the low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet for 26 weeks, with the final allocation consisting of 8 groups: IF-LF, IF-HF, SF- LF, SF-HF, IM-LF, IM-HF, CM-LF, and CM-HF. Mean food intake for each group was recorded daily, and body weight was monitored weekly throughout the study. Body composition and TEE were measured before surgery in week 0 and at the end of the study (week 26) by isotope dilution (double-labelled water). ResultsNeutered cats gained significantly more body fat and body weight (53.80 ± 5.79%) than sexu- ally intact cats (27.11 ± 5.79%) during the study. Body weight gain of neutered cats fed the HF diet was greater than those fed the LF diet. Following correc- tion for body composition, TEE was similar in all groups and no pattern towards increased food intake was evident. Conclusions and Clinical RelevanceWeight gain in neutered cats was decreased by feeding an LF, low energy-dense diet. To prevent weight gain in cats after neutering, a suitable LF diet should be fed in careful- ly controlled meals rather than ad libitum"

    "abstract": "Free tick identification has been offered by our laboratory since 1989, during which time > 8,000 specimens have been submitted. We have noted that the bite of 1 of the less frequently identified ticks, Ixodes muris Bishopp & Smith, may be associated with a severe reaction in domestic animals characterized by extreme pain and swelling at the site and, with more complete engorgement, lethargy, anorexia, and high fever. These symptoms may be confused with other serious illness if the tick is not found. This reaction has not been seen following the bite of other species of ixodid ticks in Maine. Here we report 43 such cases, most involving dogs and cats from which ticks were removed by veterinarians and submitted to our laboratory for identification. Although I. muris was initially widespread in the United States and eastern Canada, its current range is unclear. In view of the potential for severe reaction to the bite of I. muris, the current distribution of the tick needs better definition, as does the mechanism of this response in animals that are unnatural hosts."

    "abstract": "So far, the double-magnetic induction (DMI) method has been successfully applied to record eye movements from head-restrained humans, monkeys and cats. An advantage of the DMI method, compared to the more widely used scleral search coil technique, is the absence of vulnerable lead wires on the eye. A disadvantage, however, is that the relationship between the eye-in-head orientation and the secondary induction signal is highly non-linear and non-monotonic. This limits the effective measuring range to maximum eye orientations of about +/-30 degrees . Here, we analyze and test two extensions required to record the full eye-head orienting range, well exceeding 90 degrees from straight-ahead in all directions. (1) The use of mutually perpendicular magnetic fields allows for the disambiguation of the non-monotonic signal from the ring. (2) The application of an artificial neural network for offline calibration of the signals. The theoretical predictions are tested for horizontal rotations with a gimbal system. Our results show that the method is a promising alternative to the search coil technique."

Animals-Feral cats assessed from 1992 to 2003 in San Diego County, California (n = 14,452), and from 1998 to 2004 in Alachua County, Florida (11,822). Procedure-Data were analyzed with a mathematical Ricker model to describe population dynamics of the feral cats and modifications to the dynamics that occurred as a result of the TNR programs. Results-In both counties, results of analyses did not indicate a consistent reduction in per capita growth, the Population multiplier, or the proportion of female cats that were pregnant. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Success of feral cat management programs that use TNR can be monitored with an easily collected set of data and statistical analyses facilitated by population modeling techniques. Results may be used to suggest possible future monitoring and modification of TNR programs, which could result in greater success controlling and reducing feral cat populations."

    "abstract": "Various methods have allowed mapping of responses to several stimulus features on the cortical surface, particularly edge orientation and motion direction. The cortical mapping of spatial frequencies (SF), which is the basic property that leads to perception of spatial details of visual objects, is still controversial. We recorded simultaneously extracellular action potentials from neighboring cells in superficial layers of the area 17-18 border region of anesthetized cats. Responses of nearby cells to sine-wave gratings of varying SF were analyzed. Spatial frequency tuning curves were cross-correlated to establish the degree of similarity between the curves and optimal SFs were compared for each pair of neurons. The investigation showed that only about a half of nearby neurons exhibited close optimal SFs and similar tuning curves. The results suggest that SF channels do not show a clear clustering within a small pool of neurons. Such organization may contribute to the perception of spatial details at all orientations and motion directions."

Cats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: SILOVE-LS (n = 8), SILOVE-ECS (8) or open-OVE (8). Surgical time, complications, and postoperative pain scores were recorded.\\n\\nRESULTS: Single-incision laparoscopic ovariectomy was successful in (n = 8) SILOVE-LS cats and (n = 5) SILOVE-ECS cats. Surgical time was significantly longer for the SILOVE-ECS group compared with the SILOVE-LS (P < .0001) and open-OVE (P < .0001) groups, which were not different (P = .55). Complications were more frequent in the SILOVE-ECS group and removal of the SILP was required to complete ovariectomy in 3 cats. Cumulative 4-hour pain scores were not different between groups.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Single-incision laparoscopic ovariectomy using a SILP is a feasible method for OVE in cats. Single-incision laparoscopic ovariectomy using an extracorporeal suture is more time consuming and associated with more complications than either the SILOVE-LS or open-OVE methods."

DLP stimulation inhibited the responses of dorsal horn cells to both noxious and stimuli were tested. The thresholds for eliciting DLP-spinal inhibition were lowest (<30 ??A) in the region of LC. The inhibitory effect was found in both ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal horns. The DLP-spinal inhibition was unaltered by depletion of spinal catecholamines brought about by repeated lumbar intrathecal administration of reserpine.

Three TTV isolates (Sd-TTV31 from a pig, Cf-TTV10 from a dog and Fc-TTV4 from a cat) comprising 2878, 2797 and 2064 nucleotides, respectively, each had three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 436-635 (ORF1), 73-105 (ORF2) and 224-243 (ORF3) aa but lacked ORF4, similar to tupaia TTV. ORF3 was presumed to arise from a splicing of TTV mRNA, similar to human prototype TTV. Although the nucleotide sequence of Sd-TTV31, Cf-TTV10 and Fc-TTV4 differed by more than 50% from each other and from previously reported TTVs of 3.4-3.9 kb and TTV-like mini viruses (TLMVs) of 2.8-3.0 kb isolated from humans and non-human primates as well as tupaia TTVs of 2.2 kb, they resembled known TTVs and TLMVs with regard to genomic organization and presumed transcriptional profile rather than animal circoviruses of 1.7-2.3 kb. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Sd-TTV31, Cf-TTV10 and Fc-TTV4 were closer to TTVs from lower-order primates and tupaias than to TTVs from higher-order primates and TLMVs. These results indicate that domestic pigs, cats and dogs are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs with small genomic size and suggest a wide distribution of TTVs with extremely divergent genomic sequence and length in animals."

    "abstract": "We compare fMRI-BOLD responses in anesthetized cats with local field potentials (LFPs), aggregate high-frequency responses (analog-Mua) and spiking activity recorded in primary and higher visual cortex of alert animals. The similarity of the activations in these electrophysiological signals to those in the BOLD is quantified by counting recording sites where different stimuli elicit the same relative activation as in the imaging experiments. Using artificial stimuli, a comparison of BOLD and LFP strongly depends on the frequency range used. Stimulating with complex or natural stimuli reduces this frequency dependence and yields a good match of LFP and BOLD. In general, this match is best between 20 and 50 Hz. The measures of high-frequency activity behave qualitatively different: the responses of the analog-Mua match those of the LFP; the spiking activity shows a low concordance with the BOLD signal. This dissociation of BOLD and spiking activity is most prominent upon stimulation with natural stimuli."

ANIMALS: 220 anesthetized cats undergoing cross-sectional imaging. PROCEDURES: HR and PSBP were recorded at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes for untreated control cats and cats that received IIC, NIC, or GD contrast medium. The development of HR < 100 beats/min or > 200 beats/min that included a > or = 20% change from baseline was considered a response. The development of PSBP of < 90 mm Hg or > 170 mm Hg that included a > or = 20% change from baseline was considered a response. Pre- and postcontrast serum biochemical values were recorded. Results-Of cats receiving IIC medium, 2% (1/60) had a response in HR at > or = 1 time point. Of cats receiving IIC medium, 7% (4/60) had a response in PSBP. None of the cats receiving NIC medium had a response in HR; 2 of 12 had a response in PSBP. Of cats receiving GD contrast medium, 6% (5/83) had a response in HR and 8% (7/83) had a response in PSBP. None of the control cats had a response in HR or PSBP. No serum biochemical alterations were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: IV administration of iodine and GD contrast media in anesthetized cats was associated with changes in HR and PSBP."

    "abstract": "Although the great size and procumbency of the incisor teeth of many saber-toothed carnivorans have long been recognized, the potential functional significance of carnivoran incisor size and shape remains largely unexplored. Here, we explore upper incisor design and incisor arcade shape in living felids, canids, and hyaenids. In addition, we compare upper incisors of saber-toothed carnivorans with those of modern carnivorans and use these data to infer aspects of saber-tooth killing and feeding behaviors. Results demonstrate that the shape of individual upper incisors of extant carnivorans is intricately related to the dental arcade in which the teeth are rooted. Canids and hyaenids have robust incisors in parabolic arcades, whereas felid incisors are weaker, particularly in mediolateral bending, and are located in transversely linear arcades. It is proposed that the strength of the medial incisors is in part a consequence of arcade shape. Incisors in linear arcades can be weaker because they are better buttressed by adjacent incisors than is the case for incisors in curved arcades. Incisor strength in anteroposterior bending is better explained by differences in killing and feeding behavior. Arcade procumbency and incisor robusticity also appear to be common features of the upper incisors of saber-toothed carnivorans, although these features are variably developed. The upper incisors of saber-toothed felids tend to equal or exceed those of living (conical-toothed) felids in strength and are located in moderately parabolic arcades. By contrast, nimravids have massively constructed incisors in arcades that are markedly curved comparable to those of canids. We hypothesize that saber-tooths may have relied on their incisors more intensively than do living felids for prey stabilization during killing bites and for the ingestion of flesh during feeding."

    "abstract": "In decerebrated, nonanesthetized cats, we made intracellular whole-cell recordings and extracellular cell-attached recordings from granule cells in the cerebellar C3 zone. Spontaneous EPSPs had large, relatively constant peak amplitudes, whereas IPSPs were small and did not appear to contribute substantially to synaptic integration at a short time scale. In many cases, the EPSPs of individual mossy fiber synapses appeared to be separable by their peak amplitudes. A substantial proportion of our granule cells had small receptive fields on the forelimb skin. Skin stimulation evoked explosive responses in which the constituent EPSPs were analyzed. In the rising phase of the response, our analyses indicated a participation of three to four different mossy fiber synapses, corresponding to the total number of mossy fiber afferents. The cutaneous receptive fields of the driven EPSPs overlapped, indicating an absence of convergence of mossy fibers activated from different receptive fields. Also in granule cells activated by joint movements did we find indications that different afferents were driven by the same type of input. Regardless of input type, the temporal patterns of granule cell spike activity, both spontaneous and evoked, appeared to primarily follow the activity in the presynaptic mossy fibers, although much of the nonsynchronized mossy fiber input was filtered out. In contrast to the prevailing theories of granule cell function, our results suggest a function of granule cells as signal-to-noise enhancing threshold elements, rather than as sparse coding pattern discriminators or temporal pattern generators."

Systemic staging tests (complete blood count/chemistry/urinalysis/thyroxin levels/thoracic radiographs) are used to identify concurrent disease. Abdominal ultrasonography is useful to document intestinal wall thickening, mass lesions, concurrent organ involvement, lymphadenopathy, and abdominal lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound findings can be used to decide if the next diagnostic test should be laparotomy, laparoscopy, or endoscopy, with the goal of obtaining diagnostic histologic specimens. Histopathologically, lymphoma may be lymphoblastic or lymphocytic. Chemotherapy, including steroids and nutritional support, are essential in the management of alimentary lymphoma."

The greatest threat facing Taveuni's wildlife is a potential incursion by the invasive small Indian mongoose Herpestes javanicus from nearby islands, and anecdotal reports have suggested that the mongoose may already be present. To determine if mongooses were present on Taveuni 40 traps were set in two locations close to the main ports of entry, in typical mongoose habitat. Normally mongooses are easily caught if they are present, but in 204 trap nights none were captured, although eight feral cats and 11 rats were caught. None of the 31 people questioned from around the island had seen the mongoose. A list of seven recommendations is provided for a management strategy to prevent any possible incursion by mongooses and to eradicate any arrivals at the earliest opportunity."

Coherent and scrambled point-light displays of humans, cats, and pigeons that were upright or inverted were embedded in a random dot mask and presented to naive observers. Observers assessed the animacy of the walker on a six-point Likert scale in Experiment 1, discriminated the direction of walking in Experiment 2, and completed both the animacy rating and the direction discrimination tasks in Experiment 3. We show that like the ability to discriminate direction, the perception of animacy from scrambled displays that contain solely local cues is orientation specific and can be well-elicited within exposure times as short as 200 ms. We show further that animacy ratings attributed to our stimuli are linearly correlated with the ability to discriminate their direction of walking. We conclude that the mechanisms responsible for processing local biological motion signals not only retrieve locomotive direction but also aid in assessing the presence of animate agents in the visual environment."

Thirty-four households with recurrent malaria infection in 2005-2008 were selected as case households and compared with 37 control households with no malaria infection randomly selected from the same geographic area. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with household P. falciparum infection. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, cattle ownership was associated with reduced risk of P. falciparum infection (adjusted odds ratio = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.05-0.69), as was increased distance between dwelling structures (aOR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.07-0.98). Ownership of the highest category of cattle, goats, dogs, or cats dramatically reduced the risk of P. falciparum infection (aOR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03-0.56). CONCLUSION: Domestic animal, in particular cattle, ownership and greater distance between dwelling structures were associated with reduced risk of recurrent P. falciparum infection at the household level. These factors should be further investigated as supplemental measures for malaria control in rural African settings."

    "abstract": "Effects of iontophoretically applied dopamine and its receptor antagonists on physiologically identified retinal ganglion cells were studied in the optically intact eye of pentobarbitone anaesthetised kittens (7-9 weeks of age) and the results were compared with the effects obtained from adult cats (18-22 weeks of age). In both the adult and the kitten, dopamine had an inhibitory effect on visually evoked and spontaneous activity of the retinal ganglion cells, irrespective of cell type. However, unlike in the adult, the effects of dopamine in kittens were variable and not dependent on retinal eccentricity. In adult cells, only l-sulpiride (a potent D2 receptor antagonist) reduced the inhibitory effect of exogenous dopamine, whereas in kitten cells, both ??-flupenthixol (a potent D1) receptor antagonist) and l-sulpiride did so. When applied alone, neither ??-flupenthixol nor l-sulpiride affected the activity of ganglion cells in adults. but in kittens both antagonists produced an excitatory effect in some cells. Physiologically active dopaminergic innervation seemed, therefore, to be present on the immature ganglion cells, but was subsequently 'eliminated' during the course of postnatal development. Furthermore, in immature cells, both D1 and D2 type receptors are present but only D2 receptors remain in adult. Therefore, there is a mismatch between dopamine receptors and dopamine in the adult retina and this mismatch may be the consequence of a developmental event. ?? 1987."

    "abstract": "Obesity is a common nutritional disorder in cats and it increases the risk factors for various diseases. The aim of this study is to suggest a method for the evaluation of feline obesity using computed tomography. The attenuation range from -156 to -106 was determined as the range of feline abdominal adipose tissue. With this range, total (TAT), visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissues were measured. The best correlation between the adipose tissue in cross-sectional image and entire abdomen volume was obtained at the L3 and L5 levels. The mean VAT/SAT ratio was 1.18±0.32, which was much higher than in humans. The cats with an overweight body condition had a significantly lower VAT/SAT ratio than cats with an ideal body condition. This technique may contribute to both the clinical diagnosis and the experimental study of feline obesity."

    "abstract": "This study is part of a program to develop an auditory prosthesis for the profoundly deaf, based on multichannel microstimulation in the cochlear nucleus. The functionality of such a device is dependent on its ability to access the tonotopic axis of the human ventral cochlear nucleus in an orderly fashion. In these studies, we utilized the homologies between the human and feline ventral cochlear nuclei and the known tonotopic organization of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (IC). In anesthetized cats, stimuli were delivered to three or four locations along the dorsal-to-ventral axis of the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN), and for each stimulus location, we recorded the multiunit neuronal activity and the field potentials at 20 or more locations along the dorsolateral-ventromedial (tonotopic) axis of the IC. The current source-sink density (CSD), which delimits regions of neuronal activity, was computed from the sequence of field potentials recorded along this axis. The multiunit activity and the CSD analysis both showed that the tonotopic organization of the PVCN can be accessed in an orderly manner by intranuclear microstimulation in several regions of the PVCN, using the range of stimulus pulse amplitudes that have been shown in previous studies to be noninjurious during prolonged intranuclear microstimulation via chronically implanted microelectrodes. We discuss the applicability of these findings to the design of clinical auditory prostheses for implantation into the human cochlear nucleus."

Developmental disorders are the most common causes of hydrocephalus, but there are other causes as well. Diagnosis is based on the clinical features and on brain imaging to assess ventricular size and to identify any specific causes. Medical therapy can provide temporary relief but definitive treatment usually involves placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

    "abstract": "Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a hereditary eye disease leading to blindness, was found in the Abyssinian breed of cat. Sixty-eight cases of a bilateral generalized retinopathy, at different stages of the disease process, were seen in the breed during ophthalmoscopic examinations of cats throughout Sweden during a 2-year period. Forty-five percent of cats aged 2 years or older were affected in the examined group. The earliest case was diagnosed in a 16-month-old cat. At the age of 3-4 years a bilateral retinal atrophy was usually present in affected cats. Genetic analysis indicates that PRA in the Abyssinian cat is caused by an autosomal recessive gene."

    "abstract": "Transgenic mice provide a new approach for studying the structure and function of the mammalian retina. In the past, the cellular organization of the mammalian retina was investigated preferentially in primates, cats, and rats but rarely in mice. In the current study, the authors applied 42 different immunocytochemical markers to sections of the mouse retina and studied their cellular and synaptic localization by using confocal microscopy. The markers applied were from three major groups: 1) antibodies against calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin, parvalbumin, recoverin, or caldendrin; 2) antibodies that recognize specific transmitter systems, such as glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, or acetylcholine; and 3) antibodies that recognize transmitter receptors and show their aggregation at specific synapses. Only a few markers labeled only one cell type: Most antibodies recognized specific groups of neurons. These were analyzed in more detail in double-labeling experiments with different combinations of the antibodies. In light of their results, the authors offer a list of immunocytochemical markers that can be used to detect possible changes in the retinal organization of mutant mice."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish a dosing regimen for potassium bromide and evaluate use of bromide to treat spontaneous seizures in cats. DESIGN: Prospective and retrospective studies. ANIMALS: 7 healthy adult male cats and records of 17 cats with seizures. PROCEDURE: Seven healthy cats were administered potassium bromide (15 mg/kg [6.8 mg/lb], p.o., q 12 h) until steady-state concentrations were reached. Serum samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained weekly until bromide concentrations were not detectable. Clinical data were obtained from records of 17 treated cats. RESULTS: In the prospective study, maximum serum bromide concentration was 1.1 +/- 0.2 mg/mL at 8 weeks. Mean disappearance half-life was 1.6 +/- 0.2 weeks. Steady state was achieved at a mean of 5.3 +/-1.1 weeks. No adverse effects were detected and bromide was well tolerated. In the retrospective study, administration of bromide (n = 4) or bromide and phenobarbital (3) was associated with eradication of seizures in 7 of 15 cats (serum bromide concentration range, 1.0 to 1.6 mg/mL); however, bromide administration was associated with adverse effects in 8 of 16 cats. Coughing developed in 6 of these cats, leading to euthanasia in 1 cat and discontinuation of bromide administration in 2 cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Therapeutic concentrations of bromide are attained within 2 weeks in cats that receive 30 mg/kg/d (13.6 mg/lb/d) orally. Although somewhat effective in seizure control, the incidence of adverse effects may not warrant routine use of bromide for control of seizures in cats."

    "abstract": "This study quantifies the effects of marked weight gain on glucose and insulin metabolism in 16 cats which increased their weight by an average of 44.2% over 10 months. Significantly, the development of feline obesity was accompanied by a 52% decrease in tissue sensitivity to insulin and diminished glucose effectiveness. In addition, glucose intolerance and abnormal insulin response occurred in some cats. An important finding was that normal weight cats with low insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness were at increased risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance with obesity. High basal insulin concentrations or low acute insulin response to glucose also independently increased the risk for developing impaired glucose tolerance. Male cats gained more weight relative to females and this, combined with their tendency to lower insulin sensitivity and higher insulin concentrations, may explain why male cats are at greater risk for diabetes. Results suggest an underlying predisposition for glucose intolerance in some cats, which is exacerbated by obesity. These cats may be more at risk of progressing to overt type 2 diabetes mellitus."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plain language search tools for MEDLINE/PubMed are few. We wanted to develop a search tool that would allow anyone using a free-text, natural language query and without knowing specialized vocabularies that an expert searcher might use, to find relevant citations in MEDLINE/PubMed. This tool would translate a question into an efficient search. RESULTS: The accuracy and relevance of retrieved citations were compared to references cited in BMJ POEMs and CATs (critically appraised topics) questions from the University of Michigan Department of Pediatrics. askMEDLINE correctly matched the cited references 75.8% in POEMs and 89.2 % in CATs questions on first pass. When articles that were deemed to be relevant to the clinical questions were included, the overall efficiency in retrieving journal articles was 96.8% (POEMs) and 96.3% (CATs.) CONCLUSION: askMEDLINE might be a useful search tool for clinicians, researchers, and other information seekers interested in finding current evidence in MEDLINE/PubMed. The text-only format could be convenient for users with wireless handheld devices and those with low-bandwidth connections in remote locations."

    "abstract": "A 1-year cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence, risk factors for carriage, and genetic diversity of Campylobacter spp. in healthy dogs and cats in Switzerland. Veterinary practitioners collected samples from 1268 animals (all ages) presented for vaccination. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in 634 dogs and 596 cats that were eligible for the study was 41.2% (confidence interval 95%: 37.3-45.1%) and 41.9% (CI 95%: 37.9-46%), respectively. Risk factors identified for carriage of Campylobacter jejuni were found to be different from risk factors for C. upsaliensis/C. helveticus. Young animals (< or =3 years) had significantly higher odds of carrying C. upsaliensis/C. helveticus than older animals (OR 1.8-3.3), whereas for C. jejuni carriage, the age was not a risk factor. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyping revealed heterogeneity among C. jejuni strains and was found to clearly separate C. helveticus from C. upsaliensis. It was shown that cats more often carry C. helveticus with an estimated prevalence of 28.2%, whereas dogs mainly are carrying C. upsaliensis."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sinonasal disease is common in cats; chronic inflammatory disease and neoplasia are diagnosed most frequently. Radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) findings in nasal disease have been reported, although involvement of other cranial structures has not been fully described to our knowledge. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that neoplastic or inflammatory obstruction of the auditory tube associated with sinonasal disease could result in CT evidence of effusive bulla disease in affected cats. ANIMALS: 46 cats with sinonasal disease, 18 control cats. METHODS: CT images acquired in cats with (n = 46) and without (n = 18) sinonasal disease were reviewed for evidence of concurrent bulla effusion. CT findings of soft tissue or fluid opacity within the tympanic bulla or thickening of the bone of the bullae were considered evidence of effusive bulla disease. RESULTS: The prevalence of bulla effusion in cats with sinonasal disease was 28% (13/46) and was significantly higher than that observed in cats without sinonasal disease (1/18, P = .043). CT findings that were found in association with effusive bulla disease included imaging features of sinusitis and nasopharyngeal disease. The most common neoplasm associated with bulla effusion was nasopharyngeal lymphoma. Bulla effusion was not observed in any cat with nasal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Findings of this study suggest that auditory canal dysfunction may play a larger role in feline sinonasal disease than was previously recognized. The implications of these findings for management of cats with chronic inflammatory or neoplastic sinonasal disease require further investigation."

    "abstract": "© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York. OBJECTIVES: The detection of ketone bodies in urinary samples often underestimates the degree of ketonuria and may lead to false negative results due to the lack of detection of β-hydroxybutyrate. In human medicine, the standard method used to quantify and monitor ketonemia is the measurement of β-hydroxybutyrate in whole blood samples which is associated with a higher sensitivity. For this, only few devices have to date been evaluated in veterinary medicine. These have shown limitations in areas of high β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. The aim of the study was to compare the portable ketone meter GlucoMen®LX PLUS with a reference method for measurement of β-hydroxybutyrate in canine and feline venous blood samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prosepctive study, a total of 47 dogs and 55 cats were enrolled. These cases comprised patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetes mellitus and catabolic metabolism as well as healthy individuals. Comparison between the GlucoMen®LX PLUS ketone meter and an enzymatic reaction method by an automated chemistry analyzer was performed. Measurement results of dogs and cats were evaluated separately. RESULTS: There was a high correlation between measurement values of the GlucoMen®LX PLUS and the enzymatic reaction laboratory method in dogs (R = 0.99, p < 0.001) and cats (R = 0.98, p < 0.001). Mean difference was 0.01 mmol/l (SD ± 0.20) in dogs and 0.05 mmol/l (SD ± 0.29) in cats. In 44 % of all dogs and cats the GlucoMen®LX PLUS measured lower values in comparison to the reference method. Greater differences between the 2 measurement methods were apparent in both high and low β-hydroxybutyrate concentration ranges (dogs, R = -0.762 and cats, R = -0.86). In high concentration areas, the GlucoMen®LX PLUS led to slightly lower results, whereas in low concentration areas slightly higher values were measured. CONCLUSION: The GlucoMen®LX PLUS shows a strong correlation with the standard reference method and is useful for measurement of β-hydroxybutyrate in canine and feline venous blood samples. Limitations can be seen in high concentration ranges of β-hydroxybutyrate in which the GlucoMen®LX PLUS resulted in slightly lower measurement values. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The GlucoMen®LX PLUS is a cost-effective portable device representing a viable alternative to urinary ketone body measurement."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and safety for transdermal (TD) and oral administration of fluoxetine hydrochloride to healthy cats. ANIMALS: 12 healthy mixed-breed sexually intact 1- to 4-year-old purpose-bred cats. PROCEDURE: A single-dose pharmacokinetic study involving 3 groups of 4 cats each was conducted in parallel. Fluoxetine in a formulation of pluronic lecithin organogel (PLO gel) was applied to the hairless portion of the pinnae of cats at 2 dosages (5 or 10 mg/kg), or it was administered orally in capsules at a dosage of 1 mg/kg. Plasma samples were obtained and submitted for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry analysis of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine. RESULTS: Peak fluoxetine concentration (Cmax) was lower and time to Cmax longer for TD administration versus oral administration. Relative bioavailability of each dose administered via the TD route was 10% of the value for oral administration of the drug. Mean plasma elimination half-life after oral administration was 47 and 55 hours for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides evidence that fluoxetine in a 15% (wt:vol) PLO gel formulation can be absorbed through the skin of cats into the systemic circulation. However, the relative bioavailability for TD administration is approximately only 10% of that for the oral route of administration."

    "abstract": "The mammalian visual system is one of the most intensively investigated sensory systems. However, our knowledge of the typical input it is operating on is surprisingly limited. To address this issue, we seek to learn about the natural visual environment and the world as seen by a cat. With a CCD camera attached to their head, cats explore several outdoor environments and videos of natural stimuli are recorded from the animals' perspective. The statistical analysis of these videos reveals several remarkable properties. First, we find an anisotropy of oriented contours with an enhanced occurrence of horizontal orientations, earlier described in the \"oblique effect\" as a predominance of the two cardinal orientations. Second, contrast is not elevated in the center of the images, suggesting different mechanisms of fixation point selection as compared to humans. Third, analyzing a sequence of images we find that the precise position of contours varies faster than their orientation. Finally, collinear contours prevail over parallel shifted contours, matching recent physiological and anatomical results. These findings demonstrate the rich structure of natural visual stimuli and its direct relation to extensively studied anatomical and physiological issues."

    "abstract": "Human chronotypes (differences in preference for early or late rising each day) have been extensively studied in recent years, but no attempt has been made to compare human chronotypes with the chronotypes of other animal species. We evaluated behavioral chronotypes in 16 mammalian species along a body size gradient of five orders of magnitude (from mice to cattle). Individuals of all species were studied under a 12 L:12D photoperiod in a thermoneutral environment with food and water available at all times. Rhythms of locomotor activity were analyzed for onset time, acrophase, and robustness. Neither of these rhythmic parameters was significantly related to body size, but onset time and acrophase varied considerably from species to species, thus characterizing diurnal and nocturnal species. Chronotype spreads ranged from less than an hour in sheep to almost 24 h in cats, thus extending both below and above the human chronotype spread of 6 h. The variability of chronotype (as quantified by the standard deviation of group means) was much larger between species than within species and also larger between individuals of a species than within individuals on consecutive days. These results help situate the matter of human chronotypes within the broader context of variability in the phase angle of entrainment of circadian rhythms in animals."

    "abstract": "Early spay-neuter is ovariohysterectomy or castration of puppies or kittens 6 to 14 weeks of age. Pediatric animals may have an enhanced response to relatively low doses of anesthetic agents. Animals should be fasted no more than 3 to 4 hours before surgery to prevent hypoglycemia, and hypothermia should be avoided. Heart and respiratory rates must be monitored carefully throughout anesthesia. Pediatric gonadectomy surgeries are quick with minimal bleeding. Anesthetic recovery is rapid. No significant short-term or long-term effects have been reported. Prepuberal gonadectomy is most useful for humane organizations and conscientious breeders wishing to preclude reproduction of pet dogs and cats while placing animals at a young enough age to optimize socialization and training."

    "abstract": "Infection with candidatus Helicobacter heilmannii is associated with gastritis and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in people. Infection with H. heilmannii type 1 predominates (80%) and is thought to be acquired from dogs, cats, or pigs. We further examined the zoonotic potential of dogs and cats by amplifying gastric DNA from cats (n = 45) and dogs (n = 10) with primers against H. heilmannii ureB and 16S rRNA genes and sequencing the products. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with eubacterial and H. heilmannii-specific probes was employed to directly visualize H. heilmannii types and their intragastric distribution. ureB sequences of H. heilmannii amplicons clustered with human and feline isolates of H. heilmannii and were distinct from the H. heilmannii-like organisms (HHLO) H. felis, H. salomonis, and H. bizzozeronii. 16S ribosomal DNA sequences in 20 H. heilmannii-infected cats and dogs were distinct from H. heilmannii type 1 and H. suis and clustered with H. heilmannii types 2 and 4. FISH confirmed the presence of H. heilmannii types 2 and 4 in dogs but failed to definitively characterize the H. heilmannii types present in cats. In infected dogs, H. heilmannii inhabited the gastric mucus and glands, and in dogs coinfected with other HHLO it shared the same gastric niche. The results indicate that dogs and cats are predominantly colonized by H. heilmannii bacteria that are distinct from type 1 and from H. suis. As H. heilmannii type 1 predominates in people, the zoonotic risk posed by dogs and cats is likely small."

    "abstract": "A new discrete-time reverse-correlation scheme for the study of visual neurons is proposed. The visual stimulus is generated by drawing with uniform probability, at each refresh time, an image from a finite set S of orthonormal images. We show that if the neuron can be modeled as a spatiotemporal linear filter followed by a static nonlinearity, the cross-correlation between the input image sequence and the cell's spike train output gives the projection of the receptive field onto the subspace spanned by S. The technique has been applied to the analysis of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of cats and macaque monkeys. Experimental results are presented where S spans a subspace of spatially low-pass signals. Advantages of the proposed scheme over standard white-noise techniques include improved signal to noise ratios, increased spatial resolution, and the possibility to restrict the study to particular subspaces of interest."

    "abstract": "Blind individuals often demonstrate enhanced non-visual perceptual abilities. Neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation experiments have suggested that computations carried out in the occipital cortex may underlie these enhanced somatosensory or auditory performances. Thus, cortical areas that are dedicated to the analysis of the visual scene may, in the blind, acquire the capacity to participate in other sensory processing. However, the neural substrate that underlies this transfer of function is not fully characterized. Here we studied the synaptic and anatomical basis of this phenomenon in cats that were visually deprived by dark rearing, either early visually deprived after birth (EVD), or late visually deprived after the end of the critical period (LVD); data were compared with those obtained in normally reared cats (controls). The presence of synaptic and spike responses to auditory stimulation was examined by means of intracellular recordings in area 17 and the border between areas 17 and 18. While none of the cells recorded in control and LVD cats showed responses to sound, 14% of the cells recorded in EVD cats showed both subthreshold synaptic responses and suprathreshold spike responses to auditory stimuli. Synaptic responses were of small amplitude, but well time-locked to the stimuli and had an average latency of 30+/-12ms. In an attempt to identify the origin of the inputs carrying auditory information to the visual cortex, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected in the visual cortex and retrograde labeling examined in the cortex and thalamus. No significant retrograde labeling was found in auditory cortical areas. However, the proportion of neurons projecting from supragranular layers of the posteromedial and posterolateral parts of the lateral suprasylvian region to V1 was higher than that in control cats. Retrograde labeling in the lateral geniculate nucleus showed no difference in the total number of neurons between control and visually deprived cats, but there was a higher proportion of labeling in C-laminae in deprived cats. Labeled cells were not found in the medial geniculate nucleus, a thalamic relay for auditory information, in either control or visually deprived cats. Finally, immunohistochemistry of the visual cortex of deprived cats revealed a striking decrease in pavalbumin- and calretinin-positive neurons, the functional implications of which we discuss."

    "abstract": "Four hundred and seventeen Canadian veterinarians were surveyed to determine their postoperative use of analgesics in dogs and cats following 6 surgical procedures, and to determine their opinions toward pain perception and perceived complications associated with the postoperative use of potent opioid analgesics. Three hundred and seventeen (76%) returned the questionnaire. The percentage of animals receiving analgesics postoperatively ranged from 84% of dogs and 70% of cats following orthopedic surgery to 10% of dogs and 9% of cats following castration. In general, with the exception of orthopedic surgery, roughly equal percentages of dogs and cats received postoperative analgesics. Opioids were used almost exclusively to provide postoperative analgesia, with butorphanol the most commonly administered drug to both dogs and cats. Analgesics were usually administered either once or twice postoperatively. With regard to the administration of potent opioid agonists, the 3 major concerns included respiratory depression, bradycardia, and sedation in dogs, and excitement, respiratory depression, and bradycardia in cats. Seventy-seven percent of veterinarians considered their knowledge of issues related to the recognition and control of postoperative pain to be inadequate. Experience in practice is currently the major source of knowledge, with undergraduate veterinary school and research articles in journals ranked as the least important sources. Lectures or seminars delivered at the regional level were the preferred format for continuing education."

The highest worm burdens in foxes (mean of 16,792) and raccoon dogs (mean of 7930) were found at 35 dpi. These declined to a mean of just 331 worms in foxes and 3213 worms in raccoon dogs by day 63 with a further decline to 134 worms in foxes and 67 worms in raccoon dogs by day 90. In dogs, there was no significant difference between worm burdens recovered at days 35 (mean of 2466) and day 90 (mean of 1563), although reduced numbers were recovered on day 63 (mean of 899). In cats, worms were found in four animals 35 dpi (mean of 642), in three at 63 dpi (mean of 28) and in two at 90 dpi (mean of 57). Faecal egg counts were determined at 3 day intervals from 25 dpi. A mathematical model of egg excretion dynamics suggested that the mean biotic potential per infected animal was high in foxes (346,473 eggs); raccoon dogs (335,361 eggs) and dogs (279,910 eggs) but very low for cats (573 eggs). It also indicated that approximately 114, 42 and 27 eggs per worm were excreted in the faeces of dogs, raccoon dogs and foxes, respectively. The fecundity of worms in cats was low with an average of less than one egg per worm. The peak levels of coproantigen were detected earlier in foxes and raccoon dogs than in dogs. Eggs recovered from foxes, raccoon dogs and dogs resulted in massive infections in experimental mice. However, metacestodes did not develop from eggs originating from infected cats. It is concluded that foxes, raccoon dogs and dogs are good hosts of E. multilocularis. In contrast, the low worm establishment, the very few excreted eggs and the lack of infectivity of eggs strongly indicate that cats play an insignificant role in parasite transmission."

    "abstract": "Coordinated animal-human health monitoring can provide an early warning system with fewer false alarms for naturally occurring disease outbreaks, as well as biological, chemical and environmental incidents. This monitoring requires the integration and analysis of multi-field, multi-scale and multi-source data sets. In order to better understand these data sets, models and measurements at different resolutions must be analyzed. To facilitate these investigations, we have created an application to provide a visual analytics framework for analyzing both human emergency room data and veterinary hospital data. Our integrated visual analytic tool links temporally varying geospatial visualization of animal and human patient health information with advanced statistical analysis of these multi-source data. Various statistical analysis techniques have been applied in conjunction with a spatio-temporal viewing window. Such an application provides researchers with the ability to visually search the data for clusters in both a statistical model view and a spatio-temporal view. Our interface provides a factor specification/filtering component to allow exploration of causal factors and spread patterns. In this paper, we will discuss the application of our linked animal-human visual analytics (LAHVA) tool to two specific case studies. The first case study is the effect of seasonal influenza and its correlation with different companion animals (e.g., cats, dogs) syndromes. Here we use data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) and Banfield Pet Hospitals in an attempt to determine if there are correlations between respiratory syndromes representing the onset of seasonal influenza in humans and general respiratory syndromes in cats and dogs. Our second case study examines the effect of the release of industrial wastewater in a community through companion animal surveillance. 1"

    "abstract": "One of the important goals of peripheral nerve electrode development is to design an electrode for selective recruitment of the different functions of a common nerve trunk. A challenging task is gaining selective access to central axon populations. In this paper, a simple electrode that takes advantage of the neural plasticity to reshape the nerve is presented. The flat interface nerve electrode (FINE) reshapes the nerve into a flat geometry to increase the surface area and move central axon populations close to the surface. The electrode was implanted acutely on the sciatic nerve of eight cats. The FINE can significantly reshape the nerve and fascicles (p<0.0001) while maintaining the same total nerve cross-sectional area. The stimulation thresholds were 2.89 nC for pulse amplitude modulation and 10.2 nC for pulsewidth modulation. Monopolar, square-pulse stimulation with single contacts on the FINE selectively recruited each of the four main branches of the sciatic nerve. Simultaneous stimulation with two contacts produced moments about the ankle joint that were a combination of the moments produced by the individual contacts when stimulated separately."

TCID5, of the virus was 10(-7.36)/0. 05mL on MDCK cell. The cats were inoculated through bronchus route and then, the cats of dead and control were collected for histopathological and immunohistochemistry examination. Meanwhile, the emulsion supernatant fluid of organs and the pharyngeal swab samples of the dead cats were collected for RT-PCR, survived cats and the control cats were tested for the presence of HI antibody by standard method. The results indicated that the damage of lungs from the dead cats were most obvious, the wide range of red consolidation focus emerged on the lobus pulmonis, the fused focus of infection caused injury of lungs. Histology under the microscope revealed diffuse alveolar damage, confluence phlegmasia pathology, infiltration of lymphomonocytes, sackful of infiltration of macrophages and manipulus protein-like effusion in the alveolar. By immunohistochemistry, the positively stained virus particles were found on the epithelial cells of bronchus and alveolus, and also in the endochylema of lymphomonocytes. The specific electophoretic band of 464bp amplified by RT-PCR from samples of pharyngeal swabs, lungs, kidneys, hearts and brains was as same as the theory value. HI antibody titers of the survived cat were 1:32."

    "abstract": "The assumption that the pressure difference between the cochlear windows is the stimulus that produces cochlear responses is tested experimentally in the ears of anesthetized cats. Cochlear potential is used as a measure of cochlear response. The sound pressures at the oval and round windows are individually controlled with both pressures at the same frequency and amplitude. When the angle difference between the two pressures is varied over one cycle, cochlear-potential magnitude varies by about 40 dB, with a sharp minimum occurring with the angle difference near zero. A linear model of the response to the two input pressures estimates a complex common-mode gain C and a complex difference-mode gain D; magnitude of D is about 35 dB greater than magnitude of C over the frequency range that was tested (75 to 1000 Hz). Thus, except for conditions that make the common-mode input much larger than the difference-mode input, the pressure difference between the oval and round windows is, to a good approximation, the effective acoustic stimulus for the cochlea."

    "abstract": "We are developing a new type of bipolar recording electrode intended for implantation within individual fascicles of mammalian peripheral nerves. In the experiments reported here we used electrodes fabricated from 25 microns diameter Pt wire, 50 microns 90% Pt-10% Ir wire and 7 microns carbon fibers. The electrodes were implanted in the sciatic nerves of rats and in the ulnar nerves of cats. The signal-to-noise ratio of recorded activity induced by nonnoxious mechanical stimulation of the skin and joints was studied as a function of the type of electrode material used, the amount of insulation removed from the recording zone, and the longitudinal separation of the recording zones of bipolar electrode pairs. Both acute and short term (two day) chronic experiments were performed. The results indicate that a bipolar electrode made from Teflon-insulated, 25 microns diameter, 90% Pt-10% Ir wire, having a 1-2 mm long recording zone, can be used for recording of peripheral nerve activity when implanted with one wire inside the fascicle and the other lead level with the first lead, but outside the fascicle. No insulating cuff needs to be placed around the nerve trunk."

Analyses of the same sera by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) staining methods revealed 22 (24%) positives. There was good agreement in results of both tests (73% concordance). However, we measured higher titers (1:80 to 1:640) with IFA analysis than by MA methods (1:80 to 1:160). Both tests were suitable for general screening purposes. The DNA of F.tularensis was not detected in the 24 antibody-positive sera tested. Cats living in Connecticut and New York State were naturally exposed to F.tularensis or a closely related organism. With exposure to ticks, other biting arthropods, mice, and rabbits, cats are at risk for acquiring F.tularensis infections and can be an important source of information on the presence of this agent in nature."

    "abstract": "The precedence effect (PE) is a perceptual phenomenon that reflects listeners' ability to suppress echoes in reverberant environments. The PE is not present at birth and appears only several months postnatal. Recent physiological studies have demonstrated correlates of the PE in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) of adult animals. The present study extended the same techniques to search for similar correlates in the ICC of kittens during the first postnatal month. Stimuli consisted of pairs of clicks or noise bursts presented from different locations in free field or with different inter-aural differences in time (ITD) under headphones, with an inter-stimulus-delay (ISD) between their onsets. Results suggest that a physiological correlate of the PE, i.e. suppression of responses to the second source, is present as early as 8 days postnatal, and occurs at similar ISDs to those recorded in adult cats. Suppression in kitten neurons varies with stimulus level, duration, and azimuthal position, in a similar manner to that in adult neurons. The age at which correlates of the PE in the kitten can be found precedes the age at which kittens can localize sound sources effectively, and presumably before the age at which they would demonstrate the PE behaviorally. Thus, the neural mechanisms that might be involved in the first stages of processing PE stimuli may be in place well before the behavioral correlate develops."

    "abstract": "The results of an epidemiological and clinical study of flea infestations of farm animals in northern Libya is reported. Of 12,130 sheep examined from 124 flocks, 150 sheep were found to be infested with fleas from 50 different flocks. Likewise 23 goats from 2981 examined, and 11 calves from 1124 cattle examined were infested No fleas were recovered from camels or horses. Of 1861 fleas recovered from farm livestock, 1857 were Ctenocephalides felis strongylus and 4 were Pulex irritans. Dogs from farms and local clinics were also examined. Eight farms dogs were found to be infested with P. irritans. Of 79 infested dogs examined in veterinary clinics, 53 were found infested with P. irritans, 11 with Ctenocephalides felis felis, 12 had a mixed infestation of P. irritans and C. felis felis. Single dogs had mixed infestation of P. irritans and C. canis; C. felis felis and C. canis; and P. irritans, C. felis felis and Echidnophaga gallinacia. C. felis felis was also found on 15 infested cats. C. felis felis was never found on large farm animals despite frequently sharing their environment with dogs or cats. Likewise C. felis stongylus was never isolated from dogs or cats. This is consistent with the hypothesis that C. felis strongylus has become adapted to large farm animals, whilst C. felis felis is better adapted to dogs and cats. However, four stockmen were found infested with a total of 176 C. felis strongylus, which suggests that this subspecies is also a potential zoonosis. A significantly higher proportion of intensive farms had animals with flea infestation compared to semi-intensive farms. Fleas were not found in nomadic herds. Infested farm animals often presented with excoriation, alopecia, pruritis and hyperkeratitis particularly on the lower limbs. These signs are consistent with the generation of flea-bite hypersensitivity. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "abstract": "Disentangling bottom-up and top-down processing in adult category learning is notoriously difficult. Studying category learning in infancy provides a simple way of exploring category learning while minimizing the contribution of top-down information. Three- to 4-month-old infants presented with cat or dog images will form a perceptual category representation for cat that excludes dogs and for dog that includes cats. The authors argue that an inclusion relationship in the distribution of features in the images explains the asymmetry. Using computational modeling and behavioral testing, the authors show that the asymmetry can be reversed or removed by using stimulus images that reverse or remove the inclusion relationship. The findings suggest that categorization of nonhuman animal images by young infants is essentially a bottom-up process."

    "abstract": "In a retrospective study, granular cell tumors in six dogs (Nos. 1-6), three cats (Nos. 1-3), one horse (No. 1), and one cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) (No. 1) and a meningioma with a granular cell component in one dog (No. 7) were examined histologically and immunohistochemically. These tumors were identified by histologic examination of surgical biopsy specimens, except in the horse, in which the tumor was an incidental finding at necropsy. These diagnoses were initially made by more than one pathologist. Five of the six granular cell tumors in the dogs were in the oral cavity; one of these was in the maxillary gingiva of a 6-month-old puppy. The tumors in the cats were located in the tongue, vulva, and digit. The tumor in the horse was in the lung, and the tumor in the cockatiel was in the periocular tissue. Histologically, all granular cell tumors were characterized by oval to polygonal cells of various sizes. The cells had abundant, pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm with distinct intracytoplasmic granules, distinct cell margins, and mostly central nuclei. In the dogs, the gingival tumor had a large amount of collagen tissue, the tumor in the tongue had dilated blood vessels, and the maxillary tumor in the puppy was more cellular than the other tumors. The tumors in the cats were more anaplastic than the other tumors; one, located in the digit, was considered malignant. The granules in all of the tumors stained with periodic acid-Schiff and were diastase resistant. On staining with Luxol fast blue, the granules of all tumors stained different shades of pink, with the exception of the tumor in the tongue of a cat, which stained bluish green. Immunocytochemically, all tumors except the tumor in the cockatiel reacted against antibodies to vimentin. The granular cell tumor in the lung of the horse and the intracranial meningioma in a dog reacted to the antibody S-100 protein; the tumor in the horse reacted to neuron-specific enolase; tumors in two dogs (gingiva and skin) reacted to L-antitrypsin, and the maxillary tumor also reacted to lysozyme; the malignant tumor in the digit of a cat and the periocular tumor in the cockatiel reacted to muscle common actin and actin; the tumor in the cockatiel also reacted to desmin. Results of these immunocytochemical studies suggest that granular cell tumors, like tumors composed of rhabdoid cells, clear cells, and oncocytes, can have similar morphologic features but be of different cellular origins."

    "abstract": "Feline diabetes mellitus (FDM) closely resembles human type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in many respects including clinical, physiological, and pathological features of the disease. These features include age of onset of FDM in middle age, association with obesity, residual but declining insulin secretion, development of islet amyloid deposits, loss of approximately 50% of beta-cell mass, and development of complications in several organ systems including peripheral polyneuropathy and retinopathy. Many of the pathological aspects of the disease are also experimentally inducible, facilitating study of the pathogenesis of these lesions. Physiological aspects of FDM and obesity are also well studied in the cat and provide an excellent basis for comparative studies of human T2DM. The relatively short generation time of cats along with breed predispositions to development of FDM may allow for more rapid screening and identification of genetic markers for diabetes susceptibility. FDM, in both spontaneous and inducible forms, therefore provides a good animal model of human T2DM and may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of this important condition."

    "abstract": "The effects of thiamylal on the nociceptor-driven neural activity in the spinal cord were studied in decerebrate, non-anesthetized cats. Noxious stimulation was induced by the injection of bradykinin into the femoral artery and the neutral response in the lateral funiculus was measured by the multi-unit activity technique. The effects of thiamylal on the bradykinin-induced response were compared before and after the spinal cord transection, above the recording site. Thiamylal, 5 mg/kg i.v., potentiated the response significantly before the cord transection and depressed it after the transection. These findings indicate that the antianalgesic action of thiamylal is induced at the spinal cord level: although this anesthetic agent does have a direct intraspinal depressant action, the multisynaptic neural network of the supraspinal pain inhibition system is more susceptible to the actions of anesthetics, and the depression of this descending system by thiamylal results in a release of spinal cord nociceptive neural mechanisms from the supraspinal control."

Previous in vitro studies, however, indicate that staphylococci preferentially adhere to corneocytes from host species. This study compared adherence of meticillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA/MRSA), S. intermedius, S. felis and S. hominis to feline, canine and human corneocytes acquired from 10 healthy subjects using adhesive tape discs. Adherent bacteria were counted using an image processing and analysis programme. Mean adherence of MSSA (P = 0.0009), MRSA (P = 0.0162) and S. intermedius (P = 0.0117), but not S. felis or S. hominis, to feline corneocytes was significantly lower than that to canine and human corneocytes. All the isolates had similar adherence to both human and canine corneocytes. S. felis was the most adherent species to feline corneocytes followed by S. intermedius, and then MSSA, MRSA and S. hominis. For dogs and humans, S. intermedius and S. felis were the most adherent, followed by MRSA and MSSA, and then S. hominis. These results do not reveal any preferential adherence of staphylococci to canine or human corneocytes. Poor adherence to feline corneocytes could suggest that cats are relatively resistant to pyoderma and cross-species transmission of staphylococci."

    "abstract": "Emerging data indicate that more attention should be given to the detection, evaluation, monitoring, and treatment of dogs and cats with proteinuria. The purposes of this consensus statement are to describe an appropriate approach for accomplishing these tasks and to provide specific recommendations for assessing and managing dogs and cats with proteinuria based on data that are currently available. Because proteinuria and albuminuria have numerous possible causes, they must be assessed appropriately to determine their implications for the patient. This assessment involves localization of the origin of the proteinuria as well as determination of its persistence and magnitude. Because persistent renal proteinuria usually indicates presence of chronic kidney disease, which sometimes is a progressive disorder, its detection identifies dogs and cats that have increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Thus, urine testing that will detect proteinuria should be a component of the clinical evaluations of dogs and cats under all circumstances that prompt their veterinarians to also perform comprehensive hematologic and serum biochemical evaluations. At a minimum, this testing should consist of a complete urinalysis that includes a satisfactorily accurate semiquantitative test for protein, and positive reactions should be properly followed with further testing. The appropriate response to persistent renal proteinuria depends on the magnitude of proteinuria and the status of the patient. The recommended response generally involves continued monitoring, further investigation, and therapeutic intervention, which should be implemented as an escalating series of inclusive, stepwise responses."

    "abstract": "This paper is aimed at investigating whether there is ample support for the view that the acceptance criterion for evaluating measures for prevention of oil spills from tankers should be based on cost-effectiveness considerations. One such criterion can be reflected by the Cost of Averting a Tonne of oil Spilt (CATS) whereas its target value is updated by elaborating the inherent uncertainties of oil spill costs and establishing a value for the criterion's assurance factor. To this end, a value of $80,000/t is proposed as a sensible CATS criterion and the proposed value for the assurance factor F=1.5 is supported by the retrieved Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Clubs' Annual Reports. It is envisaged that this criterion would allow the conversion of direct and indirect costs into a non-market value for the optimal allocation of resources between the various parties investing in shipping. A review of previous cost estimation models on oil spills is presented and a probability distribution (log-normal) is fitted on the available oil spill cost data, where it should be made abundantly clear that the mean value of the distribution is used for deriving the updated CATS criterion value. However, the difference between the initial and the updated CATS criterion in the percentiles of the distribution is small. It is found through the current analysis that results are partly lower than the predicted values from the published estimation models. The costs are also found to depend on the type of accident, which is in agreement with the results of previous studies. Other proposals on acceptance criteria are reviewed and it is asserted that the CATS criterion can be considered as the best candidate. Evidence is provided that the CATS approach is practical and meaningful by including examples of successful applications in actual risk assessments. Finally, it is suggested that the criterion may be refined subject to more readily available cost data and experience gained from future decisions."

However, DTI is\\nlimited in representing complex white matter architecture, notably\\nin the presence of crossing fibres. Recently, q-ball imaging (QBI)\\nhas been proposed as a new method for recovering complex white matter\\narchitecture. We applied this technique to both ex vivo and in vivo\\nspinal cords of cats using a 3T scanner. For the purpose of comparison,\\ngradients have been applied in 55 and 100 encoding directions and\\nb-values varied from 800 to 3000 s/mm(2). As a result, QBI was able\\nto retrieve crossing fibre information, where the DTI approach was\\nconstrained in a unique diffusion direction. To our knowledge, this\\nis the first study demonstrating the benefits of QBI for detecting\\nthe presence of longitudinal, commissural and dorso-ventral fibres\\nin the spinal cord.

    "abstract": "Companion animals represent an under-utilised resource. The present paper is designed to encourage collaborative studies. Dogs and cats are out-bred animals that are willing to consume a consistent diet for long periods, so are ideal candidates for prospective studies of naturally-occurring disease. In some studies the effect of diet on survival has been substantial. Food restriction, for example, slows the development of osteoarthritis and increases the lifespan of Labrador retrievers by 2 years, protein and P restriction more than doubles the median survival time of dogs and cats with chronic kidney disease and adding n-3 fats and arginine to the diet of dogs with stage 3 lymphoma improves median survival time by one-quarter. Obesity is also very common in both dogs and cats and is also associated with disease as in human subjects. When interpreting these results, however, it is essential to take into account pathophysiological differences among species. Dogs and cats do not display all the characteristics of metabolic disease in human subjects, they metabolise fat well and atherosclerosis and cardiac infarction are uncommon. Such differences should not, however, preclude further study because differences among species often clarify knowledge. Monitoring of disease in companion animals may also provide a surveillance system for the safety of the food supply, as illustrated by recent outbreaks of acute renal failure and liver failure in cats and dogs in the USA caused respectively by melamine and mycotoxin contamination of pet foods."

    "abstract": "1. Single-unit responses in the dorsal cochlear nucleus of unanesthetized, decerebrate cats have been divided into two categoreis. These have been differentiated on the basis of responses to best-frequency tones. Type IV units responded to best-frequency tones with excitation from threshold to about 20 or 30 dB above threshold; at higher levels, their response was inhibitory. In a few cases, the excitatory area near threshold was not seen and in a few others, the response became excitatory again at high levels. Type IV units could be divided into two groups based on the length of time that inhibition was maintained in response to long tones. Type IV units are not seen in anesthetized cats. 2. Type II/III units responded to best-frequency tones of all levels with excitation. Nonmonotonic rate versus level functions were seen in type II/III units, but they were of much less drastic character; the discharge rate of nonmonotonic type II/III units was still well above spontaneous rate for tones 50 dB above threshold. Type II/III units defined in this way were found to have, on the average, lower rates of spontaneous activity and higher thresholds than type IV units. 3. Type II/III units responded weakly to broad-band noise in comparison to auditory nerve fibers and many of them did not respond at all to noise. Type IV units, with best frequencies above 0.9 kHz, gave excitatory responses to noise. 4. The inhibitory response areas of type IV units could be divided into two areas: a central inhibitory area in the vicinity of best frequency where on- and off-discharges and afterdischarges were seen; and inhibitory side bands at higher and lower frequencies where simple inhibitory responses were seen. In four units, it was possible to show that the central inhibitory area was converted to an excitatory area after administration of an anesthetic dose of pentobarbital. 5. Most type II/III and type IV units could be excited or inhibited by stimuli in the contralateral ear. Broad-band noise was a more effective contralateral stimulus than tones at the ipsilateral best frequency. 6. On the basis of the properties of type II/III and type IV cells, it is suggested that type II/III responses are recorded from interneurons which provide a large share of the inhibitory imput to type IV cells."

    "abstract": "In congenitally deaf cats, the central auditory system is deprived of acoustic input because of degeneration of the organ of Corti before the onset of hearing. Primary auditory afferents survive and can be stimulated electrically. By means of an intracochlear implant and an accompanying sound processor, congenitally deaf kittens were exposed to sounds and conditioned to respond to tones. After months of exposure to meaningful stimuli, the cortical activity in chronically implanted cats produced field potentials of higher amplitudes, expanded in area, developed long latency responses indicative of intracortical information processing, and showed more synaptic efficacy than in naïve, unstimulated deaf cats. The activity established by auditory experience resembles activity in hearing animals."

Methods: Clinical data from 11 first opinion veterinary practices were extracted for the year 2007. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed to assess the usage of antimicrobials. Results: Widespread usage of systemic broad-spectrum antimicrobials was observed. Antimicrobials most frequently used in both species were potentiated amoxicillin (44·4% and 46.1% in cats and dogs, respectively) and amoxicillin (14·3% and 20·7%). Cephalexin (13·4%) and cefovecin (15·0%) were also commonly used in dogs and cats, respectively. Systemic critically important antimicrobials in human medicine were widely used in dogs (60·5%) and cats (82·7%). Topical antimicrobials used in both species included fusidic acid (48·4% and 54·8%), framycetin (20·4% and 13·4%), polymyxin B (12·6% and 9·3%) and neomycin (6·5% and 6·6%). Clinical Significance: Inappropriate usage of broad-spectrum antimicrobials may contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance and loss of efficacy of antimicrobials in veterinary settings. Data recorded in practice management systems were demonstrated to be a practical source for monitoring antimicrobial usage in pets."

    "abstract": "A related group of parvoviruses infects members of many different carnivore families. Some of those viruses differ in host range or antigenic properties, but the true relationships are poorly understood. We examined 24 VP1/VP2 and 8 NS1 gene sequences from various parvovirus isolates to determine the phylogenetic relationships between viruses isolated from cats, dogs, Asiatic raccoon dogs, mink, raccoons, and foxes. There were about 1.3% pairwise sequence differences between the VP1/VP2 genes of viruses collected up to four decades apart. Viruses from cats, mink, foxes, and raccoons were not distinguished from each other phylogenetically, but the canine or Asiatic raccoon dog isolates formed a distinct clade. Characteristic antigenic, tissue culture host range, and other properties of the canine isolates have previously been shown to be determined by differences in the VP1/VP2 gene, and we show here that there are at least 10 nucleotide sequence differences which distinguish all canine isolates from any other virus. The VP1/VP2 gene sequences grouped roughly according to the time of virus isolation, and there were similar rates of sequence divergence among the canine isolates and those from the other species. A smaller number of differences were present in the NS1 gene sequences, but a similar phylogeny was revealed. Inoculation of mutants of a feline virus isolate into dogs showed that three or four CPV-specific differences in the VP1/VP2 gene controlled the in vivo canine host range."

    "abstract": "The African golden cat Profelis aurata is a little known felid endemic to Africa's trop-ical forests. The golden cat is very poorly known but is currently the subject of two related studies in Uganda and Gabon, the first focused research efforts on the spe-cies. We conducted three systematic camera trap surveys in Kibale National Park, Uganda, and obtained 63 photographic captures of African golden cats at frequen-cies ranging from 0.53 to 1.35 captures per 100 trap days. We identified variation in capture rates between sites for golden cats and other species that warrants further investigation. These results will contribute to our ongoing research as we inves-tigate golden cat ecology in the role of apex predator, intraguild interactions with other forest carnivores and responses to anthropogenic influences. The African golden cat has never been the object of intensive scientific research, and its behaviour and ecology are poorly known (Ray et al. 2005). This medium-sized (5.3 – 16 kg) stocky cat is endemic to the African tropical forest belt where it is threatened by defore-station, clearing for agriculture, persecution and exploitation of its prey (Nowell & Jack-son 1996, Hunter & Barrett 2011). The spe-cies is estimated by Ray et al. (2005) to have lost 44% of original range and it is currently classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List (Henschel et al. 2008). African golden cats are notoriously elusive. Even in research sites with constant resear-cher effort, they are very rarely observed by chance (T. Struhsaker & J. Lwanga pers. comm.), which partly explains a lack of data on the species. While their preference for dense forest presents challenges for moni-toring, recent efforts to apply camera-trapp-ing methodologies (Bahaa-el-din et al. 2011) have demonstrated potential in furthering our understanding of the golden cat. Here, we report on the results of three sys-tematic camera trap surveys undertaken for African golden cats in Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda. This is the second of two ar-ticles presenting preliminary data from two Panthera-led studies currently underway in Gabon (Bahaa-el-din et al. 2011) and Ugan-da using camera-trap technology to"

Of 1,263 unique E. coli isolates from humans, pigs, chickens, turkeys, sheep, cows, goats, cats, dogs, horses, geese, ducks, and deer, 31% were highly resistant to tetracycline. More than 78, 47, and 41% of the E. coli isolates from pigs, chickens, and turkeys were resistant or highly resistant to tetracycline, respectively. Tetracycline MICs for 61, 29, and 29% of E. coli isolates from pig, chickens, and turkeys, respectively, were >/=233 micro g/ml. Muliplex PCR analyses indicated that 97% of these strains contained at least 1 of 14 tetracycline resistance genes [tetA, tetB, tetC, tetD, tetE, tetG, tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, tetS, tetA(P), tetQ, and tetX] examined. While the most common genes found in these isolates were tetB (63%) and tetA (35%), tetC, tetD, and tetM were also found. E. coli isolates from pigs and chickens were the only strains to have tetM.

    "abstract": "The comparative development of Echinococcus multilocularis was studied in its definitive hosts, the fox, dog, cat and raccoon dog, beyond the pre-patent period to 90 days post-infection. All host species, apart from cats were susceptible to infection and capable of supporting substantial worm burdens. Although worms in cats matured and produced thick-shelled eggs, their overall development was retarded compared to that in other species in which the parasite matured rapidly producing large populations of gravid worms. E. multilocularis matured rapidly in foxes and raccoon dogs and this was sustained in raccoon dogs but not in foxes in which maturation of worms declined during the later stages of infection, in contrast to that in both raccoon dogs and dogs. These populations were sustained for longer in raccoon dogs and dogs compared to foxes. Cats would appear to have only a minor role in the maintenance of E. multilocularis in endemic areas, and infections in cats may be of minimal public health significance. In contrast, foxes, dogs and the recently recognized definitive host the raccoon dog, are all capable of playing significant roles in the epidemiology of alveolar echinococcosis. This study also demonstrated that the developmental processes of growth, segmentation, proglottization and maturation in adult Echinococcus are independent and can be influenced by environmental factors thus confirming earlier in vitro observations."

Study Design: Case series. Animals: Cats (n=47). Methods: Data were obtained from the medical records (2002-2009) of cats that had undergone ureterolithotomy procedures. Multiple preoperative factors were evaluated for association of survival to discharge. Result: Survival to discharge after ureterolithotomy was 79% (37/47). Over 79% of cats were azotemic before surgery and 94% had chronic kidney disease changes at the time of ultrasonographic diagnosis. Six cats required an additional surgical procedure because of complications with ureterolithotomy. Overall prevalence of postoperative uroabdomen was 6% (3/47). On multivariate analysis, there were no preoperative variables significantly associated with survival to discharge. Conclusions: Ureterolithotomy in cats was associated with a 21% mortality rate before hospital discharge. No preoperative variables associated with mortality were identified; therefore, further studies are needed to identify more discriminating preoperative characteristics for mortality after ureterolithotomy in this population of cats."

    "abstract": "A 12-day-old baby was admitted to our hospital with a fever, irritability, and poor feeding. His temperature was 39° C. On physical examination, he was irritable but consolable. His anterior fontanelle was full but not bulging. Laboratory tests included a complete blood cell count, which showed a white blood cell count of 4·8 × 10⁹ per L, with 72% neutrophils. Analysis of the infant's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 3 050 white blood cells per µL, with 94% neutrophils, protein concentration was 110 mg/dL, and glucose concentration 49 mg/dL (normal 60-80). CSF showed Gram-negative coccobacilli, not typical of an enteric pathogen-eg, Escherichia coli. Treatment with two antibiotics was commenced: intravenous ampicillin 50 mg/kg every 6 h and intravenous ceftazidime 50 mg/kg every 6 h. 2 days later, the infant was afebrile and improving clinically. Blood and CSF cultures grew Pasteurella multocida (figure). Further history revealed that the family had no cats but did have two dogs-a Maltese Poodle and a Bichon Shih Tzu. The dogs loved the new addition to the family-the baby-and showed their delight and affection by licking his face. The infant was treated for 14 days with intravenous ampicillin 50 mg/kg every 6 h. At follow-up, 1 year later, he was well and developing normally. And more specifically, he had no hearing deficits. P multocida is a small, Gram-negative coccobacillus, first recognised in 1881 by Louis Pasteur. It is present in the oral microbiota of 70-90% of cats and 50-66% of dogs and is a common pathogen associated with bites. Infection can also result from simple mucosal contact with saliva and from vertical transmission from a colonised mother. P multocida meningitis, with or without sepsis, is rare; most cases occur in infants, especially neonates, and immunocompromised patients. So far, 30 cases of P multocida meningitis have been reported in neonates. Most were linked to exposure to saliva without bites or vertical transmission from an asymptomatic mother colonised with P multocida. The mortality rate for neonatal P multocida meningitis, with or without sepsis, is 20%. Increased neonatal mortality is associated with disease onset occurring within 72 h of birth, a birthweight less than 2500 g, and infection due to vertical transmission. Sequelae, commonly hearing loss, occur in 20-30% of survivors. Household pets can harbour zoonotic pathogens capable of being spread by multiple mechanisms. Contact with dog or cat saliva through a bite or lick risks exposure to oral cavity commensal organisms such as Capnocytophaga canimorsus and P multocida. Allowing pets to show such affection for a newborn baby is best avoided. Contributors We both provided care and managed the patient. Written consent for publication was obtained from the patient's parents."

The thoracic duct and its branches were clearly delineated in CT images of seven cats studied. The thoracic duct was characterized by anatomic variation and appeared as single or multiple branches. The thoracic duct and the cisterna chyli were identified along the ventral or left ventral aspect of the vertebrae from the level of the cranial lumbar to the caudal cervical vertebrae. The thoracic duct was identified in the central caudal mediastinum, deviated to the left in the cranial mediastinum, and finally moved toward the venous system. Small volumes of extranodal contrast medium leakage were identified in all cats. After injection, the mesenteric lymph nodes were cytologically normal. Ultrasound-guided CT lymphography via percutaneous mesenteric lymph node injection appears safe and effective in cats."

    "abstract": "Domestic cat (Felis catus L.) advocates have formed coalitions whose goals are to promote the welfare of cats through the use of a specific nonlethal population control method. This method consists of trapping, neutering, and releasing cats into supervised cat colonies located on private and public lands, including state and county parks and natural areas. Advocates believe that this method will help reduce the number of unwanted cats and stabilize the population of unwanted cats over time. Furthermore, advocates claim that established colonies are temporary in nature and will decrease in size over time through death and adoption. This claim was tested through photographic and observational capture-recapture techniques in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA, in two Metro-Dade County parks (A, D. Barnes Park and Crandon Marina). Although the number of original colony members decreased over time, illegal dumping of unwanted cats and the attraction of stray cats to provisioned food offset reductions in cat numbers caused by death and adoption. Furthermore, overall population size of the colony at A. D. Barnes Park increased over time, and at Crandon Marina neither decreased nor increased over time. Our study suggests that this method is not an effective means to control the population of unwanted cats and confirms that the establishment of cat colonies on public lands encourages illegal dumping and creates an attractive nuisance. We recommend that advocates of cat colonies seek a long-term solution to the pet overpopulation issue by redirecting their efforts toward the underlying problem of managing irresponsible pet owners."

    "abstract": "Rather than using different therapies in isolation, many cancer patients use different therapies in a complementary fashion. Little research to date has given attention to individuals' experiences of the combined use of biomedically oriented health care (BHC) and complementary and alternative therapies (CATs). Therefore, this paper examines one individual's negotiation between complementary self-care methods and BHC in the treatment of cancer in Stockholm, Sweden. Using narrative analysis, we explore how a personal narrative is told, in addition to what is told, in order to see how the meaning of the negotiation between different therapies is created. Our analysis suggests that the BHC retains a vital role as a frame of reference for the use of certain CATs. It is also apparent how one CAT can be used for different purposes simultaneously by one individual. A positive example is given of how a spouse interpreted his experience of successful communication about CATs with a BHC provider as indicative of a shift from a hierarchical to a more collaborative relationship. Such increased collaboration between stakeholders is an important aspect of models of 'integrative health care'. Our findings highlight the need for an open and respectful dialogue about CATs between patients, their significant others and BHC providers."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Community interactions can produce complex dynamics with counterintuitive responses. Synanthropic community members are of increasing practical interest for their effects on biodiversity and public health. Most studies incorporating introduced species have been performed on islands where they may pose a risk to the native fauna. Few have examined their interactions in urban environments where they represent the majority of species. We characterized house cat (Felis catus) predation on wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), and its population effects in an urban area as a model system. Three aspects of predation likely to influence population dynamics were examined; the stratum of the prey population killed by predators, the intensity of the predation, and the size of the predator population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Predation pressure was estimated from the sizes of the rat and cat populations, and the characteristics of rats killed in 20 alleys. Short and long term responses of rat population to perturbations were examined by removal trapping. Perturbations removed an average of 56% of the rats/alley but had no negative long-term impact on the size of the rat population (49.6+/-12.5 rats/alley and 123.8+/-42.2 rats/alley over two years). The sizes of the cat population during two years (3.5 animals/alley and 2.7 animals/alley) also were unaffected by rat population perturbations. Predation by cats occurred in 9/20 alleys. Predated rats were predominantly juveniles and significantly smaller (144.6 g+/-17.8 g) than the trapped rats (385.0 g+/-135.6 g). Cats rarely preyed on the larger, older portion of the rat population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The rat population appears resilient to perturbation from even substantial population reduction using targeted removal. In this area there is a relatively low population density of cats and they only occasionally prey on the rat population. This occasional predation primarily removes the juvenile proportion of the rat population. The top predator in this urban ecosystem appears to have little impact on the size of the prey population, and similarly, reduction in rat populations doesn't impact the size of the cat population. However, the selected targeting of small rats may locally influence the size structure of the population which may have consequences for patterns of pathogen transmission."

    "abstract": "Bite infections can contain a mix of anaerobes and aerobes from the patient's skin and the animal's oral cavity, including species of Pasteurella, Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Capnocytophaga. Domestic cat and dog bite wounds can produce substantial morbidity and often require specialised care techniques and specific antibiotic therapy. Bite wounds can be complicated by sepsis. Disseminated infections, particularly those caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Pasteurella multocida, can lead to septic shock, meningitis, endocarditis, and other severe sequelae. An emerging syndrome in veterinary and human medicine is meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections shared between pets and human handlers, particularly community-acquired MRSA disease involving the USA300 clone. Skin, soft-tissue, and surgical infections are the most common. MRSA-associated infections in pets are typically acquired from their owners and can potentially cycle between pets and their human acquaintances."

    "abstract": "Standard recommendations as to how much to feed dogs and cats are based on the average requirements of unstressed healthy laboratory dogs and cats of normal body condition undertaking modest amounts of exercise in a thermoneutral environment, but most clinical patients do not conform to these norms. Most clinicians estimate the energy expenditure of patients using a factorial calculation that adjusts for any differences from the norm, but little information exists upon which to base these adjustments. Furthermore, individual variation in energy expenditure is substantial even in dogs and cats under closely defined physiological conditions, and the estimate of energy expenditure obtained by using a factorial calculation can differ by a substantial margin from the energy expenditure of an individual. Detailed dietary histories provide an estimate of individual energy requirements but are time consuming to perform and rely on several assumptions. There are also no readily available point-of-care methods for measuring the energy expenditure of dogs and cats. There is a need, therefore, for further research concerning factors that affect energy expenditure of dogs and cats and methods of measuring energy expenditure in individual patients."

The activity patterns of the small carnivores in Sabangau were generally similar to those reported elsewhere, but demonstrates the possible behavioural flexibility of the Common Palm Civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus. Of equal interest are the species not sighted despite >6,000 trap nights including Sunda Stink-badger (Mydaus javanensis), Masked Palm Civet (Paguma larvata) and Banded Civet (Hemigalus derbyanus) thus highlighting possible implications for the distribution of these species."

    "abstract": "Neurons in sensory cortices are often assumed to be \"feature detectors\", computing simple and then successively more complex features out of the incoming sensory stream. These features are somehow integrated into percepts. Despite many years of research, a convincing candidate for such a feature in primary auditory cortex has not been found. We argue that feature detection is actually a secondary issue in understanding the role of primary auditory cortex. Instead, the major contribution of primary auditory cortex to auditory perception is in processing previously derived features on a number of different timescales. We hypothesize that, as a result, neurons in primary auditory cortex represent sounds in terms of auditory objects rather than in terms of feature maps. According to this hypothesis, primary auditory cortex has a pivotal role in the auditory system in that it generates the representation of auditory objects to which higher auditory centers assign properties such as spatial location, source identity, and meaning."

    "abstract": "Grooming in small felids has received little attention compared with grooming in rodents, bovids and primates where grooming is also common. This study set out to describe the general pattern, time budget and degree of cephalocaudal sequencing of self-oral grooming in the domestic cat. In 11 cats confined for the purposes of videotaping, sleeping and resting accounted for 50% of the time budget. Oral grooming, 91% of which was to multiple body regions, accounted for 4% of the overall time budget or 8% of non-sleeping/resting time. Scratch grooming, always directed to single regions, occupied about 1/50 of the time of oral grooming. There was a moderate and significant cephalocaudal trend to grooming. An increased likelihood for oral grooming to follow periods of sleep or rest was indicated by a significant negative correlation between sleep/rest duration and latency to the subsequent grooming bout. The effect of enforced deprivation of grooming on the subsequent occurrence of grooming was explored by the 3-day application of Elizabethian collars, which prevented oral grooming or control collars that did not prevent grooming. In the 12 h immediately after removal of the Elizabethian collars, oral grooming increased by 67% and scratch grooming by 200% compared with the grooming rate after removal of control collars. By the second 12 h, the apparent catch-up effect of grooming had disappeared. The occurrence of cephalocaudally-directed, multiple-region oral grooming and deprivation-enhanced grooming would appear to represent aspects of a central control mechanism for the organization and regulation of grooming."

    "abstract": "Fishborne zoonotic trematodes (FZT) are widespread in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. It is now recognized that the risk of being infected from eating raw fish dishes applies not only to humans, but also to domestic animals (e.g., cats, dogs, and pigs) and fish-eating birds. The role of ducks and chicken, commonly raised on fish farms, as reservoir hosts, however, has not been adequately investigated. To study this question, chickens and ducks from integrated poultry-fish farms in Nghia Lac and Nghia Phu communes, Nam Dinh province, Vietnam were surveyed for FZT infections. A total of 50 ducks and 50 chickens from each commune were examined. Results revealed that 12% of chickens and 30% of ducks were infected with various species of trematodes, including two zoonotic species, Centrocestus formosanus and Echinostoma cinetorchis. Both occurred in chickens whereas only E. cinetorchis was found in ducks. Prevalence of these zoonotic species was 12% and 7% in ducks and chickens, respectively. Among other trematodes, Hypoderaeum conoideum, also a zoonotic fluke, was the most prevalent (20-30%). The feeding of snails and fish remains to poultry, either intentionally or by discharge of waste from the slaughter of ducks and chickens into the ponds, was identified as risk factors for trematode infection. The FZT species and low prevalence found in poultry in these communes indicate their role as reservoir hosts is minor."

    "abstract": "© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012. All rights reserved.The conflict between increasing human population and biodiversity conservation is one of the IUCN’s key threatening processes. Conservation planning has received a great deal of coverage and research as a way of conserving biodiversity yet, while theoretically successful, it has never been tested. Simple lines on maps to illustrate conservation areas are unlikely to be successful in the light of human encroachment. It may be that some form of overt display is necessary to ensure the protection of reserves. This may be signage, presence of guards/rangers or physical fencing structures. The need for some form of barrier goes beyond restricting human access. The megafauna of Africa pose a genuine threat to human survival. In southern Africa, fences keep animals in and protect the abutting human population. Elsewhere, fencing is not considered important or viable. Where poverty is rife, it won’t take much to tip the balance from beneficial conservation areas to troublesome repositories of crop-raiders, diseases and killers. Conversely, in New Zealand fences are used to keep animals out. Introduced species have decimated New Zealand’s endemic birds, reptiles and invertebrates, and several sites have been entirely encapsulated in mouse-proof fencing to ensure their protection. Australia faces the same problems as New Zealand, however surrounds its national parks with cattle fences. Foxes and cats are free to enter and leave at will, resulting in rapid recolonisation following poisoning campaigns. How long will these poison campaigns work before tolerance, aversion or resistance evolves in the introduced predator populations?"

Most people who have cats have two or more cats. Failure to understand what will promote either friendly or aggressive behavior can lead to various behavior problems, including aggression and conflict over resources, such as food, resting sites and litterboxes. An understanding of the natural social organization, relationships and communication between cats is therefore essential, and is the subject of this paper."

    "abstract": "Sound duration is important for distinguishing auditory object. Previous studies on the neural representation of duration have usually lacked psychophysical data obtained from the same species; hence, the correspondence between neural and behavioral discrimination of duration remains obscure. We addressed this issue in cats by using the signal detection theory to investigate both neural activities in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the cat's behavioral performance. We found that 320 ms duration can be well discriminated from 10 ms duration by some A1 neurons with specific response patterns: sustained response extended proportionally with the increase of stimulus duration and the On-Off response synchronizing stimulus onset and offset. Neurons with only On response cannot discriminate duration. The discrimination performance of both sustained and On-Off responses deteriorated as the target duration decreased from 320 to 20 ms and the percentage of discriminative neurons (correct rate >0.75) decreased from 40 to 2%. Compared with the psychophysical results, we found that the psychometric functions of cats well matched the neurometric functions of most sustained-response neurons and a small number of On-Off-response neurons. Pooling the spikes of multiple units improved neural discrimination, which may be attributable to the salience (noise reduction) of the responses in pooled data. Our results suggest that the sustained and Off responses of A1 neurons underlie the duration discrimination behavior of cats."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although formalin has been widely used as an algesic substance in rodent studies, the unique biphasic effect seen in rats is not present in humans. Humans, like cats, have a monophasic behavioral response to formalin injection. Electrophysiologically, spinal dorsal horn neurons in cats also have what could be considered a monophasic response after the initial burst of activity following formalin injection. Although several studies of the effects of ketamine on formalin responses have been carried out in rodents, we are unaware of similar studies in cats. We hypothesize that such species differences may explain observed differences in preemptive analgesic effects. Therefore, we examined the effects of ketamine on activity of spinal wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons evoked by formalin injection in cats. METHODS: We investigated in cats the effect of ketamine on the activity of WDR neurons in the spinal dorsal horn that was evoked by formalin. In addition, we studied the effects of pre- and post-administration of ketamine on the maintained phase of the formalin response. Each dose was a subanesthetic, anesthetic or high anesthetic dose (3.0 mg x kg(-1), 10 mg x kg(-1), and 30 mg x kg(-1)). RESULTS: Intravenously administered ketamine produced a dose-dependent depression of evoked activity that was significantly greater when the drug was administered before formalin. CONCLUSION: In spite of the species differences in responses to formalin, there still appears to be a clear preemptive effect of ketamine in the cat. Species differences may not explain apparent differences between human and animal preemptive analgesia."

    "abstract": "<p> Feeding raw meat-based diets (RMBDs) to companion animals has become increasingly popular. Since these diets may be contaminated with bacteria and parasites, they may pose a risk to both animal and human health. The purpose of this study was to test for the presence of zoonotic bacterial and parasitic pathogens in Dutch commercial RMBDs. We analysed 35 commercial frozen RMBDs from eight different brands. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> serotype O157:H7 was isolated from eight products (23 per cent) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing <italic>E coli</italic> was found in 28 products (80 per cent). <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> was present in 19 products (54 per cent), other <italic>Listeria</italic> species in 15 products (43 per cent) and <italic>Salmonella</italic> species in seven products (20 per cent). Concerning parasites, four products (11 per cent) contained <italic> <italic>Sarcocystis</italic> cruzi </italic> and another four (11 per cent) <italic>S tenella</italic> . In two products (6 per cent) <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> was found. The results of this study demonstrate the presence of potential zoonotic pathogens in frozen RMBDs that may be a possible source of bacterial infections in pet animals and if transmitted pose a risk for human beings. If non-frozen meat is fed, parasitic infections are also possible. Pet owners should therefore be informed about the risks associated with feeding their animals RMBDs. </p>"

    "abstract": "It has previously been suggested that neurons with line and edge selectivities found in primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys form a sparse, distributed representation of natural scenes, and it has been reasoned that such responses should emerge from an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to find a factorial code of independent visual features. We show here that a new unsupervised learning algorithm based on information maximization, a nonlinear \"infomax\" network, when applied to an ensemble of natural scenes produces sets of visual filters that are localized and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximization network. In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since this infomax network performs Independent Components Analysis or ICA, for sparse (super-gaussian) component distributions. We compare the resulting ICA filters and their associated basis functions, with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA). The ICA filters have more sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes. They also resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex, which suggests that these neurons form a natural, information-theoretic coordinate system for natural images."

    "abstract": "Otitis externa in cats is relatively uncommon. This report describes a case of a rare, visually distinctive, proliferative and necrotising otitis in a three-month-old Persian kitten. The cat had proliferative, erythematous and necrotic tissue covering most of the proximal pinnae and vertical ear canals. On histopathological examination, the most striking feature was the existence of scattered apoptotic-appearing keratinocytes within severely hyperplastic epithelium. For the first time, immunohistochemistry was used to show a closed association between CD3(+) T cells and caspase-3 stained keratinocytes, consistent with a keratinocyte apoptosis by epidermal-infiltrating T cells. Treatment was initiated using topical tacrolimus twice daily and an ear cleanser once daily. A marked improvement was observed after 10 days of treatment and the lesions completely resolved over a period of three weeks. The origin of T cells directed against keratinocytes is currently unknown."

    "abstract": "Aims: Individuals with spinal cord injury or neurological disorders may develop bladder contractionsat low volumes (neurogenic detrusor overactivity), which can lead to signiant health problems.Present devices can inhibit unwanted contractions through continuous electricalstimulation of sensory nerves, but do not enable conditional stimulation only at the onset of bladdercontractions. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationship between the electricalactivity of external anal sphincter (EAS) and bladder pressure during neurogenic detrusor contractionsand to determine whether EAS activity could be used to detect the onset of bladder contractions.Methods: Bladder pressure and EAS electromyogram (EMG) were recorded in nine adultmale cats. Retrospective clinical data consisting of bladder pressure and EAS EMG from 41 spinalcord injured individuals with neurogenic detrusor overactivity were analyzed. A CUSUM algorithmwas used to detect the onset of bladder contractions from the EAS EMG. Results: EASEMG activity increased at the onset of bladder contractions in six cats (dyssynergic) and decreased(synergic) in three cats. The onset of bladder contractions was detected within 3 sec of the start ofthe contraction for both the synergic and dyssynergic data sets. The onset of bladder contractionswas detected within 1 sec of the start of the bladder contraction for both synergic and dyssynergichuman subjects. Conclusions: Recordings of the EAS EMG can be used to detect robustly theonset of neurogenic detrusor contractions. The EAS EMG is a suitable signal to control closed-loopinhibitory electrical stimulation to maintain urinary continence."

In anaesthetized rats, cisapride at intravenous infusion of 10 and 30 mg/kg/hr for 1 hr prolonged the electrocardiographic RR and QT intervals, whereas at 3 mg/kg/hr, it prolonged the RR interval without affecting the QT interval. Mosapride at 30 mg/kg/hr for 1 hr slightly, but not significantly, prolonged the QT interval. In anaesthetized guinea-pigs, cisapride at intravenous infusion of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg over 15 min. prolonged the RR interval (18-44%), QT interval (18-42%) and the corrected QT interval (QTc; 8-19%). Mosapride at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg over 15 min. little affected the QTc although at 30 mg/kg, it slightly prolonged the RR and QT intervals. With repeated oral administrations of 30 mg/kg twice a day for 7 days, cisapride prolonged the QT interval (11-35%) and QTc (11-32%) at the 3rd and 7th days in conscious cats. In addition, cisapride depressed the ST segment in two out of five cats. Mosapride at 60 mg/kg twice a day for 7 days did not affect the QT interval or QTc in cats. The maximal plasma concentrations of mosapride and its main metabolite (a des-4-fluorobenzyl-mosapride) at the 7th day in cats were 9.4+/-2.8 microM and 2.5+/-0.3 microM , respectively, being 100 and 30-60 times higher than those in man given therapeutic doses (Sakashita et al. 1993a&b). These results indicate that mosapride has little arrhythmogenic potential."

    "abstract": "In cats with central retinal lesions, deprivation of the lesion projection zone (LPZ) in primary visual cortex (area 17) induces remapping of the cortical topography. Recovery of visually driven cortical activity in the LPZ involves distinct changes in protein expression. Recent observations, about molecular activity changes throughout area 17, challenge the view that its remote nondeprived parts would not be involved in this recovery process. We here investigated the dynamics of the protein expression pattern of remote nondeprived area 17 triggered by central retinal lesions to explore to what extent far peripheral area 17 would contribute to the topographic map reorganization inside the visual cortex. Using functional proteomics, we identified 40 proteins specifically differentially expressed between far peripheral area 17 of control and experimental animals 14 days to 8 months postlesion. Our results demonstrate that far peripheral area 17 is implicated in the functional adaptation to the visual deprivation, involving a meshwork of interacting proteins, operating in diverse pathways. In particular, endocytosis/exocytosis processes appeared to be essential via their intimate correlation with long-term potentiation and neurite outgrowth mechanisms."

The findings identified linguistic, conceptual, social and cultural scaffolding as part of the CATs personal practical knowledge. Also, the findings demonstrated that CATs knowledge of cultural scaffolding is limited in comparison to other scaffolding strategies. The findings have an impact on the nature of ELL instruction and its effectiveness."

A CAT is a standardized, one-page summary of research evidence organized around a clinical question. A CAT includes a clinical bottom line that reflects synthesis of a research article and clinical application of the results. The synthesis includes a critique of the internal, external, and statistical validity of the research. The process of writing CATs has been used in the preparation of evidence-based practitioners. Commonly used websites for preparation and posting of CATs are included as well as an example of a CAT on the topic of cerebral palsy."

    "abstract": "Kinematic state feedback is important for neuroprostheses to generate stable and adaptive movements of an extremity. State information, represented in the firing rates of populations of primary afferent (PA) neurons, can be recorded at the level of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Previous work in cats showed the feasibility of using DRG recordings to predict the kinematic state of the hind limb using reverse regression. Although accurate decoding results were attained, reverse regression does not make efficient use of the information embedded in the firing rates of the neural population. In this paper, we present decoding results based on state-space modeling, and show that it is a more principled and more efficient method for decoding the firing rates in an ensemble of PA neurons. In particular, we show that we can extract confounded information from neurons that respond to multiple kinematic parameters, and that including velocity components in the firing rate models significantly increases the accuracy of the decoded trajectory. We show that, on average, state-space decoding is twice as efficient as reverse regression for decoding joint and endpoint kinematics."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize the synchrony that occurs between cell discharges in the superior colliculus of the awake cat. We trained cats to perform a visual fixation in the presence of a visual moving stimulus and then recorded 686 pairs of neighboring cells in the superior colliculus during task performance. A new method to assess the significance of precise discharge synchronization is described, which permits analysis of nonstationary data. Of 181 pairs with sufficient data for quantitative analysis, 125 showed a cross-correlation histogram (CCH) with features assessed as significant using this approach. CCHs frequently showed an isolated central peak (41 of 125) or a peak flanked by one or two troughs (68 of 125), and in a few cases an oscillatory pattern of approximately 65 Hz (16 of 125). This is in contrast to the oscillation frequency reported for the visual cortex and shows that oscillations in the superior colliculus probably arise from a cortex-independent mechanism. Our method also permits direct quantification of the correlation shift predictors, assessing precise time locking of spikes to the stimulus. Only 1 of 125 cross-correlation shift predictors had a significant central peak, meaning that most of the CCH features were not related to cell discharges time-locked to the stimulus presentation. Further investigation using a burst-jittering method showed that synchrony in the superior colliculus is attributable to precise synchronization of short bursts of spikes. Such synchrony could be related to the network dynamics and the common inhibitory feedback from local interneurons, which would act as temporal selectors of the cells with greatest or fastest response."

The presence of a cat with FVL and its infectivity to the natural vector in Belo Horizonte city, an endemic area of VL in Brazil, suggests the need for further studies to determine the rate of occurrence of FVL among domestic cats and the infectivity ratio of L. longipalpis in endemic areas, and what is the role of these animals in the epidemiology of the disease."

Animal models that have been used in the past include non-human primates, dogs, cats, rodents, rabbits, guinea pigs and minipigs, all of which have advantages and disadvantages. Sheep are a promising model for various reasons: they are docile, easy to handle and house, relatively inexpensive, available in large numbers, spontaneously ovulate, and the sheep's bones are large enough to evaluate orthopaedic implants. Most animal models have used females and osteoporosis in the male has been largely ignored. Recently, interest in development of appropriate prosthetic devices which would stimulate osseointegration into osteoporotic, appendicular, axial and mandibular bone has intensified. Augmentation of osteopenic lumbar vertebrae with bioactive ceramics (vertebroplasty) is another area that will require testing in the appropriate animal model. Using experimental animal models for the study of these different facets of osteoporosis minimizes some of the difficulties associated with studying the disease in humans, namely time and behavioral variability among test subjects. New experimental drug therapies and orthopaedic implants can potentially be tested on large numbers of animals subjected to a level of experimental control impossible in human clinical research."

    "abstract": "Eye, head, and body movements jointly control the direction of gaze and the stability of retinal images in most mammalian species. The contribution of the individual movement components, however, will largely depend on the ecological niche the animal occupies and the layout of the animal's retina, in particular its photoreceptor density distribution. Here the relative contribution of eye-in-head and head-in-world movements in cats is measured, and the results are compared to recent human data. For the cat, a lightweight custom-made head-mounted video setup was used (CatCam). Human data were acquired with the novel EyeSeeCam device, which measures eye position to control a gaze-contingent camera in real time. For both species, analysis was based on simultaneous recordings of eye and head movements during free exploration of a natural environment. Despite the substantial differences in ecological niche, photoreceptor density, and saccade frequency, eye-movement characteristics in both species are remarkably similar. Coordinated eye and head movements dominate the dynamics of the retinal input. Interestingly, compensatory (gaze-stabilizing) movements play a more dominant role in humans than they do in cats. This finding was interpreted to be a consequence of substantially different timescales for head movements, with cats' head movements showing about a 5-fold faster dynamics than humans. For both species, models and laboratory experiments therefore need to account for this rich input dynamic to obtain validity for ecologically realistic settings."

    "abstract": "As part of a study on the ecology of a community of middle-sized and larger mammals in a seasonally dry forest in the far north of the Brazilian Amazonia, peccaries (the white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari and the collared peccary Tayassu tajacu) and large cats (the jaguar Panthera onca and the puma Puma concolor) were regularly surveyed for 1 year. Diurnal and nocturnal surveys were carried out by the line-transect method, in five different forest types along a 10 km transect, and data were collected on their use of the forest types. The peccary herds and the large cats were sighted regularly throughout the study period, but more frequently over the dry season in the high-ground forests in eastern Maraca. Over the dry season, when food was scarce except in the Buritizals, T. pecari, closely followed by a P. onca, monopolized the Buritizal forests, whereas T. tajacu, followed by a P. concolor, exploited the other available high-ground forest types. Fluctuations in food supply regulated the dynamics of the two species of peccaries, which ultimately determined the whereabouts of the large cat predators. This may be a counter-strategy to survive in an extremely seasonal environment where food, more than any other variable, is the key determinant of the survival of both peccaries and large cats."

    "abstract": "The responses of neurons to natural sounds and simplified natural sounds were recorded in the primary auditory cortex (AI) of halothane-anesthetized cats. Bird chirps were used as the base natural stimuli. They were first presented within the original acoustic context (at least 250 msec of sounds before and after each chirp). The first simplification step consisted of extracting a short segment containing just the chirp from the longer segment. For the second step, the chirp was cleaned of its accompanying background noise. Finally, each chirp was replaced by an artificial version that had approximately the same frequency trajectory but with constant amplitude. Neurons had a wide range of different response patterns to these stimuli, and many neurons had late response components in addition, or instead of, their onset responses. In general, every simplification step had a substantial influence on the responses. Neither the extracted chirp nor the clean chirp evoked a similar response to the chirp presented within its acoustic context. The extracted chirp evoked different responses than its clean version. The artificial chirps evoked stronger responses with a shorter latency than the corresponding clean chirp because of envelope differences. These results illustrate the sensitivity of neurons in AI to small perturbations of their acoustic input. In particular, they pose a challenge to models based on linear summation of energy within a spectrotemporal receptive field."

Using this method, three points of a single nucleotide in the cytochrome b gene were examined in these species using primers of different lengths. Our method was found to be able to successfully identify humans (26 samples), dogs (21 samples) and cats (9 samples), and no differences were found among the samples from each animal species in this study. The amount of template DNA required was over 0.01 ng for humans and dogs, and over 0.1 ng for cats. The present method was able to identify animal species from hair shaft (2 cm) and forensic casework samples (blood stains and hair shafts), and is thus a useful tool for animal species (human, dog and cat) identification in forensic science."

Blood, urine, and kidney were collected and tested by culture, microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among rats, 26% were positive by PCR, including 7% that were also positive by culture for L. interrogans serovars Grippotyphosa, Pyrogenes, and Icterohaemorrhagiae. L. borpetersenii serovar Polonica was isolated for the first time in Egypt in three rats. MAT titers ≥ 1:800 were observed in 11% of rats and 12% of dogs. L. interrogans serovar Grippotyphosa was detected in one cat. Sheep and donkeys were negative for leptospirosis by all methods. Buffaloes and cattle were seropositive in 20% and 44% of animals, respectively. Data indicate that several pathogenic serovars are circulating in the animals, which may pose exposure risks and account for high rates of acute febrile illness."

    "abstract": "Crossbreeding with free-ranging domestic cats is supposed to threaten the genetic integrity of wildcat populations in Europe, although the diagnostic markers to identify \"pure\" or \"admixed\" wildcats have never been clearly defined. Here we use mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences and allelic variation at 12 microsatellite loci to genotype 128 wild and domestic cats sampled in Italy which were preclassified into three separate groups: European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris), Sardinian wildcats (Felis silvestris libyca), and domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus), according to their coat color patterns, collection localities, and other phenotypical traits, independently of any genetic information. For comparison, we included some captive-reared hybrids of European wild and domestic cats. Genetic variability was significantly partitioned among the three groups (mtDNA estimate of F(ST) = 0.36; microsatellite estimate of R(ST) = 0.30; P < 0.001), suggesting that morphological diversity reflects the existence of distinct gene pools. Multivariate ordination of individual genotypes and clustering of interindividual genetic distances also showed evidence of distinct cat groups, partially congruent with the morphological classification. Cluster analysis, however, did not enable hybrid cats to be identified from genetic information alone, nor were all individuals assigned to their populations. In contrast, a Bayesian admixture analysis simultaneously assigned the European wildcats, the Sardinian wildcats, and the domestic cats to different clusters, independent of any prior information, and pointed out the admixed gene composition of the hybrids, which were assigned to more than one cluster. Only one putative Sardinian wildcat was assigned to the domestic cat cluster, and one presumed European wildcat showed mixed (hybrid) ancestry in the domestic cat gene pool. Mitochondrial DNA sequences indicated that three additional presumed European wildcats might have hybrid ancestry. These four cats were sampled from the same area in the northernmost edge of the European wildcat distribution in the Italian Apennines. Admixture analyses suggest that wild and domestic cats in Italy are distinct, reproductively isolated gene pools and that introgression of domestic alleles into the wild-living population is very limited and geographically localized."

    "abstract": "After lateral gastrocnemius-soleus (LGS) nerve section in intact cats, a rapid locomotor compensation involving synergistic muscles occurs and is accompanied by spinal reflex changes. Only some of these changes are maintained after acute spinalization, indicating the involvement of descending pathways in functional recovery. Here, we address whether the development of these adaptive changes is dependent on descending pathways. The left LGS nerve was cut in three chronic spinal cats. Combined kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were obtained before and for 8 d after the neurectomy. An increased yield at the ankle was present early after neurectomy and, as in nonspinal cats, was gradually reduced within 8 d. Compensation involved transient changes in step cycle structure and a longer term increase in postcontact medial gastrocnemius (MG) EMG activity. Precontact MG EMG only increased in one of three cats. In a terminal experiment, the influence of group I afferents from MG and LGS on stance duration was measured in two cats. LGS effectiveness at increasing stance duration was largely decreased in both cats. MG effectiveness was only slightly changed: increased in one cat and decreased in another. In cat 3, the plantaris nerve was cut after LGS recovery. The recovery time courses from both neurectomies were similar (p > 0.8), suggesting that this spinal compensation is likely a generalizable adaptive strategy. From a functional perspective, the spinal cord therefore must be considered capable of adaptive locomotor plasticity after motor nerve lesions. This finding is of prime importance to the understanding of functional plasticity after spinal injury."

    "abstract": "Bariatric surgery is considered the most effective current treatment for morbid obesity. Since the first publication of an article by Kremen, Linner, and Nelson, many experiments have been performed using animal models. The initial experiments used only malabsorptive procedures like intestinal bypass which have largely been abandoned now. These experimental models have been used to assess feasibility and safety as well as to refine techniques particular to each procedure. We will discuss the surgical techniques and the postsurgical physiology of the four major current bariatric procedures (namely, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion). We have also reviewed the anatomy and physiology of animal models. We have reviewed the literature and presented it such that it would be a reference to an investigator interested in animal experiments in bariatric surgery. Experimental animal models are further divided into two categories: large mammals that include dogs, cats, rabbits, and pig and small mammals that include rats and mice."

    "abstract": "Eighteen cats were anesthetized and were randomly assigned to 2 groups (9 cats/group). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed on each cat, with the cat in dorsal (group 1) or lateral (group 2) recumbency, by administering 5 external cardiac compressions/1 interposed (diastolic) ventilation (American Heart Association [AHA] technique; n = 3 cats/technique), simultaneous compression and ventilation (SCV; n = 3 cats/technique), or SCV with 1 interposed (diastolic) ventilation every tenth compression (SCV/DV; n = 3 cats/technique). Fourteen of the 18 cats were resuscitated. Central aortic and venous pressures were determined concurrently with lead II electrocardiography. Arterial blood samples were collected during the base-line period (after pressure fluctuations had stabilized, with the cats spontaneously breathing room air), 2.5 minutes after the onset of arrest (defined as the cessation of aortic pressure fluctuations), and after 10 minutes of CPR. Arterial blood gas values during the base-line period or during the period of arrest were not significantly different between group-1 and group-2 cats. After CPR, arterial pH and bicarbonate values were not significantly different between groups or between technique categories. The PaCO2 values were significantly lower in cats resuscitated by SCV or by SCV/DV than in cats resuscitated by AHA (P less than 0.05). The PaO2 values were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher in group-2 cats than in group-1 cats and were significantly (P less than 0.001) different between each technique category, with cats resuscitated by AHA having the lowest PaO2 and cats resuscitated by SCV/DV having the highest PaO2. Body position, CPR technique, sex, weight, or arterial blood gas values after CPR were not predictors of successful resuscitation."

    "abstract": "Summary In cats, primary or secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia have rarely been described or characterised. The objective of this study was to determine platelet-bound antibodies (PBA) by a flow cytometric assay in both healthy and thrombocytopenic cats. Direct PBA testing was performed in 42 thrombocytopenic cats (platelet counts 6-179 x 109/l, median 56 x 109/l). Of these 42 cats, 19 had positive PBA test results, 17 of which were considered to have secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (sITP). Underlying diseases included fat necroses (four cases), feline infectious peritonitis (three), feline leukaemia virus (two) or feline immunodeficiency virus (two) infections, lymphoma (two), leukaemia (one), hepatitis (one), pyelonephritis (one), or hyperthyroidism (one). In two cats, no underlying disease was found suggesting a primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (pITP). The PBA test was negative in 23 cats diagnosed with varying underlying diseases and in 47 healthy control cats with platelet values within the reference range. Only seven of the 42 cats with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 10-57 x 109/l, median 34 x 109/l) had spontaneous bleeding. This study suggests that immune-mediated destruction of platelets might be an important pathological mechanism for feline thrombocytopenia caused by various underlying diseases. In cats, pITP appears to be rarely diagnosed."

    "abstract": "In order to produce its desired effect, anaesthesia acts upon neuronal elements by modifying membrane conductances and transmitter interactions. The effect of higher doses of isoflurane, widely used in clinical settings, on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is meanwhile ignored. In this study we investigated the integrity of the BBB during various levels of isoflurane anaesthesia (1% and 3%) in cats by monitoring the extravasation of Evans blue. Simultaneously we measured the electroencephalogram (EEG), with particular emphasis on its direct current (DC) component. High doses of anaesthetic (3%) broke down the BBB in the cortex and thalamus, while milder doses (1%) only opened the BBB in the thalamus. The fluorescent signal of Evans blue was visible over an extravascular length of 23 mum in the cortex and 25 mum in the thalamus, similar to the diffusion of the same dye when the BBB was disrupted with mannitol. The opening of the BBB was associated with (i) a positive DC shift in the EEG measured on the scalp and (ii) an evaluated increase in cerebral volume of 2-2.8%. The opening of the BBB by high doses of isoflurane brings into discussion hitherto unexplored effects of anaesthesia on the brain. The electrophysiological correlate provided by the DC component of the EEG constitutes a promising option for the assessment of the BBB integrity during human anaesthesia."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis was that Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores would be lower, and mechanical wound thresholds (MWT) higher, in cats receiving tolfenamic acid compared to those receiving placebo in the postoperative period following elective ovariohysterectomy. ANIMALS: Sixty-nine client-owned cats. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, blinded and placebo-controlled study was performed in cats which underwent ovariohysterectomy following preoperative tolfenamic acid, meloxicam, or placebo. A second dose of the same analgesic was administered 24 hours postoperatively. Assessments were made 1-hour before induction and 1, 2, 4, 6, 22, and 25 hours postoperatively. Pain was assessed by a blinded observer using Numerical Rating (NRS) and VAS scales. The MWT were measured using a force-measuring device. Group comparison was performed by using one-way ANOVA and chi-squared test for qualitative and quantitative data, respectively, and a mixed model for repeated measurements (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Sixty-five cats were included in the study. There were no differences between groups at baseline. There was a treatment effect on the NRS scores at 6, 22 and 25 hours. The meloxicam group was less painful than controls at 6 and 22 hours; both treatment groups were less painful than controls at 25 hours. There were no differences between groups in VAS for pain or sedation. The number of animals receiving rescue analgesia did not differ between groups. There was a treatment effect on MWT; thresholds in both treatment groups were significantly higher than that observed in controls at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative tolfenamic acid or meloxicam reduced wound sensitivity following ovariohysterectomy in the cat. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Tolfenamic acid and meloxicam administered preoperatively provided a similar analgesic effect in the postoperative period lasting 24 hours. Mechanical thresholds may be a better way of evaluating postoperative analgesia provided by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in cats."

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5 and H7 subtypes primarily infect poultry but are occasionally transmitted to humans and other mammalian species, often causing severe disease. Previously we have shown that HPAIV H5N1 causes severe systemic disease in cats. In this study, we investigated whether HPAIV H7N7 isolated from a fatal human case is also able to cause disease in cats. Additionally, we compared the cell tropism of both viruses by immunohistochemistry and virus histochemistry. Three domestic cats were inoculated intratracheally with HPAIV H7N7. Virus excretion was restricted to the pharynx. At necropsy, 7 days post inoculation, lesions were restricted to the respiratory tract in all cats. Lesions consisted of diffuse alveolar damage and colocalized with virus antigen expression in type II pneumocytes and nonciliated bronchiolar cells. The attachment patterns of HPAIV H7N7 and H5N1 were similar: both viruses attached to nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, as well as alveolar macrophages. These data show for the first time that a non-H5 HPAIV is able to infect and cause respiratory disease in cats. The failure of HPAIV H7N7 to spread beyond the respiratory tract was not explained by differences in cell tropism compared to HPAIV H5N1. These findings suggest that HPAIV H5N1 possesses other characteristics that allow it to cause systemic disease in both humans and cats. Copyright © American Society for Investigative Pathology."

    "abstract": "When functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) is used to restore the use of paralyzed limbs after a spinal cord injury or stroke, it may be possible to control the stimulation using feedback information relayed by natural sensors in the skin. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the force applied on glabrous skin can be extracted from the electroneurographic (ENG) signal recorded from the sensory nerve. We used the central footpad of the cat hindlimb as a model of the human fingertip and recorded sensory activity with a cuff electrode chronically implanted around the tibial nerve. Our results showed that the tibial ENG signal, suitably liltered, recmed, and smoothed carries detailed static and dynamic information related to the force applied on the footpad. We derived a mathematical model of the force-ENG relation that provided accurate estimates of the ENG signal for a wide range of force proliles, amplitudes, and frequencies. Once fitted to data obtained in one recording session, the model could be made to fit data obtained in other sessions from the same cat, as well as from other cats, by simply adjusting its overall gain and offset. However, the model was noninvertible; i.e., the force could not be similarly predicted from the ENG signal, unless additional assumptions or restrictions were introduced. We discuss the reasons for these findings and their implications on the potential use of nerve signals as a source of continuous force feedback information suitable for closed-loop control of FNS."

    "abstract": "The effects of ambulatory training on the extent and time course of recovery of weight-bearing-stepping in cats spinalized (T12-T13) as adults were investigated. One month after spinal cord transection, 14 of 16 cats were capable of bearing the full weight of their hindquarters with their hind limbs during stepping on a motor-driven treadmill if the tail was pinched or crimped. Of those 14 cats 8 were assigned to a trained and 6 to an untrained group. Trained cats were subjected to 30 min/day of treadmill exercise, 5 days/week. Training was initiated 1 month posttransection and continued until 5 to 7 months posttransection. Daily records were kept on the treadmill speeds used, the time at each speed, and the number of steps that were not full weight bearing. The number of full-weight-bearing steps times treadmill speed was used as a measure of performance. The tail was crimped whenever necessary, but was required less and less as training progressed. Performance plateaus were reached between 25 and 85 days after initiating training (mean = 48 ± 22 days). Maximum treadmill speeds increased in untrained cats from 0.075 ± 0.042 m/s 1 month posttransection to 0.240 ± 0.042 m/s 5 to 7 months posttransection and those of trained cats increased from 0.079 ± m/s to 0.619 ± 0.133 m/s during this same period. We conclude that a much larger proportion of adult spinal cats are capable of full-weight-bearing stepping than reported, and that training which emphasizes early tail crimping and complete weight bearing at all times results in marked improvements in the locomotor capacity of the hind limbs. © 1986."

    "abstract": "The clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features of 10 cats with epitheliotropic intestinal malignant lymphoma (EIL) are described. Intestinal biopsy samples were reviewed by 3 pathologists to confirm the diagnosis of EIL. These samples (n = 10) were compared to the intestinal biopsies of normal cats (n = 11), cats with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; n = 7), and cats with non-EIL (n = 9) for quantification and immunophenotyping of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Immunophenotypic studies were performed with CD3 and CD79a antibody stains to assess for T- and B-cell immunoreactivity, respectively. EIL biopsies had markedly more intraepithelial lymphocytes than normal intestine (NRL) and samples from cats with IBD. However, no marked difference was observed in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes in cats with non-EIL compared to cats with EIL. Regardless of the histologic diagnosis, the intraepithelial lymphocytes in all cats were small- to intermediate-sized T cells. Clinical findings and imaging studies in the cats identified minimal or nonspecific findings in affected cats. Most cats fit the typical profile of cats with IBD or alimentary malignant lymphoma. Nine of 10 cats with EIL were treated with prednisone with or without additional chemotherapy. Four cats were refractory to chemotherapy and were euthanized within 3.5 months. The remaining 5 cats had long-term survival times of 11 months or greater. The median survival time was 11 months. Additional studies are warranted to better characterize EIL and its relationship to IBD in cats and non-EIL and to identify optimal treatment strategies for this disease."

    "abstract": "Cochlear implants have been implanted in over 110,000 deaf adults and children worldwide and provide these patients with important auditory cues necessary for auditory awareness and speech perception via electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve (AN). In 1942, Woolsey and Walzl presented the first report of cortical responses to localised electrical stimulation of different sectors of the AN in normal hearing cats, and established the cochleotopic organization of the projections to primary auditory cortex. Subsequently, individual cortical neurons in normal hearing animals have been shown to have well characterized input-output functions for electrical stimulation and decreasing response latencies with increasing stimulus strength. However, the central auditory system is not immutable, and has a remarkable capacity for plastic change, even into adulthood, as a result of changes in afferent input. This capacity for change is likely to contribute to the ongoing clinical improvements observed in speech perception for cochlear implant users. This review examines the evidence for changes of the response properties of neurons in, and consequently the functional organization of, the central auditory system produced by chronic, behaviourally relevant, electrical stimulation of the AN in profoundly deaf humans and animals."

    "abstract": " A high concentration of dietary carbohydrate is suggested to increase the risk of obesity and diabetes mellitus in domestic cats. To evaluate this, food intake, body weight, fat mass and circulating adiposity-related factors were determined in twenty-four sexually mature (9–12 months) cats assigned to four six-cat dietary groups balanced for body weight and sex. The effect of dietary fat in exchange for carbohydrate at 9, 25, 44 and 64 % of metabolisable energy (ME) in a purified diet of constant protein:ME ratio was studied 13 weeks before and 17 weeks after gonadectomy (GX). Body weight did not significantly change among the cats before GX except for an increase of 17 ( sem 5) % in cats given the highest-fat diet. Following GX, all groups gained body weight, and body fat mass was positively correlated ( r 0·50; P  < 0·04) with dietary fat percentage. Post-GX weight gains were much greater for females (+39 ( sem 5) %) than males (+10 ( sem 4) %). Plasma ghrelin concentration negatively correlated ( P  < 0·02) with dietary fat percentage and, before GX, was greater ( P  < 0·05) in females than males. Plasma insulin concentration increased with weight gain induced by high dietary fat. Plasma glucose, TAG and leptin concentrations were not affected by dietary fat percentage, GX or weight gain. These data provide evidence that in cats, high dietary fat, but not carbohydrate, induces weight gain and a congruent increase in insulin, while GX increases sensitivity to weight gain induced by dietary fat.

    "abstract": "Reflexively evoked and eye-related eyelid responses were recorded using the search coil in a magnetic field technique in alert cats. The downward phase of a blink was a large (up to 21 deg), fast (up to 2000 deg s-1) eyelid displacement in the closing direction, with an almost fixed rise time duration (15-20 ms); its maximum velocity was achieved in ~10 ms. Upward eyelid motion was separated into two phases. The first phase consisted of a fast eyelid displacement, with a short duration (approximately 30 ms) and a maximum velocity up to 900 deg s-1. The second phase had an exponential-like form, lasting for 200-400 ms, and a maximum velocity ranging between 30 and 250 deg s-1. Maximum blink velocity in the downward direction was linearly related to maximum velocity of the first upward phase. The first phase in the upward direction was never observed if the eyelid stayed closed for a long period (> 50 ms) or moved slowly in the closing direction before it started to open. In these two cases, the upswing motion of the blink reflex contained only the exponential-like movement characteristic of the second upward phase, and maximum velocity in the downward direction was not related to that of the eyelid upward displacement. Mean duration of eyelid downward saccades was approximately 130 ms, and their peak velocities ranged between 50 and 440 ms. A physiological model is presented explaining the active and passive forces involved in both reflex and saccadic eyelid responses. A second-order system seems to be appropriate to describe the postulated biomechanical model."

    "abstract": "In lightly barbiturized cats, the discharges of neurons in the cerebellar fastigial nucleus (CBM) were recorded while single muscles in ipsilateral forelimb were activated by direct stimulation. The aim was a) to verify whether CBM cells could selectively detect the activity of afferent fibers from a muscle or a joint and b) to compare the various response characteristics of the rostral and the caudal division of the nucleus, which are known to control a different muscular periphery. Six muscles were routinely tested, two axial, two proximal and two distal ones. A good percentage of neurons in both partitions of the nucleus responded to the muscles tested (53% and 48% in the rostral and caudal part, respectively). In the rostral part of CBM a large proportion of cells (78% of those responsive) were influenced by one or more muscles having either the same function (the extensors or flexors) or acting on the same joint. Many such neurons showed a marked capability to respond to activation of distal muscles and a prevalence of inhibitory responses mainly on contraction of extensor and axial muscles. In the caudal division of the nucleus, 47% of the responsive cells displayed a stereotyped discharge pattern (excitatory or inhibitory) in response to activation of any tested muscle. In contrast to the rostral CBM the incidence of responses to proximal and distal muscles was about equal in the caudal CBM and a majority of neurons had excitatory responses to flexor muscle contraction. The latencies of the excitatory effects ranged from 8 to 53 ms in rostral and 9 up to 69 ms in caudal CBM. Inhibitory responses were seen at latencies between 9-78 ms in rostral and 9-80 ms in the caudal parts of the nucleus, the distribution in the latter being bimodal. The high specificity of the responses observed in rostral CBM to the activation of ipsilateral forelimb muscles is consistent with the suggestion that the nuclear output influences the same peripheral area. The conspicuous number of neurons with inhibitory responses detected on contractions of axial and extensor muscles could possibly be due to an inhibitory feedback from the peripheral muscles to the rostral CBM division. With regards to the caudal part of the nucleus, which is known to facilitate contralateral extensor muscles, the excitatory effects seen on ipsilateral flexor muscle activation could support a mechanism of postural balance."

The diets of exotic cats kept in captivity are usually based on the nutrient requirements of the domestic cat, although there is some evidence that different cat species may not metabolize certain nutrients in the same manner as domestic species. This article provides information on the natural diet and behavior of the serval and caracal and offers insight into some health issues that may arise in a domestic environment."

    "abstract": "The homeostasis of GABA is critical to normal brain function. Extracellular levels of GABA are regulated mainly by plasmalemmal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters. Whereas the expression of GABA transporters has been extensively studied in rodents, validation of this data in other species, including humans, has been limited. As this information is crucial for our understanding of therapeutic options in human diseases such as epilepsy, we have compared, by immunocytochemistry, the distributions of the GABA transporters GAT-1 and GAT-3 in rats, cats, monkeys and humans. We demonstrate subtle differences between the results reported in the literature and our results, such as the predominance of GAT-1 labelling in neurons rather than astrocytes in the rat cortex. We note that the optimal localisation of GAT-1 in cats, monkeys and humans requires the use of an antibody against the human sequence carboxyl terminal region of GAT-1 rather than against the slightly different rat sequence. We demonstrate that GAT-3 is localised mainly to astrocytes in hindbrain and midbrain regions of rat brains. However, in species such as cats, monkeys and humans, additional strong immunolabelling of oligodendrocytes has also been observed. We suggest that differences in GAT distribution, especially the expression of GAT-3 by oligodendrocytes in humans, must be accommodated in extrapolating rodent models of GABA homeostasis to humans."

    "abstract": "The responses of 15 cats with histologically (n=14) or cytologically (n=1) confirmed nasal squamous cell carcinoma treated with (90)Strontium plesiotherapy were reviewed retrospectively. Cats were treated such that a total dose of 50Gy was delivered at a depth of 2mm, administered in five fractions over a 10-day period. Of the cats, 11 were stage T(2), three were T(is) and one had only a cytological diagnosis precluding staging. Eleven of the cats achieved complete response (no visible lesion after 6-8 weeks) following the first cycle of therapy, and two cats with partial response achieved complete response with a second cycle of therapy. The remaining two cats achieved partial response following therapy, but further intervention was declined. Euthanasia was performed in these two cats because of progressive disease after 81 and 142 days. Of the 85% of cats that achieved a complete response, there was no recurrence of disease during a follow-up period of 134-2,043 days (median 652 days). In addition to prolonged disease-free survivals, (90)Strontium therapy produced excellent cosmetic results from the owners' perspective. These results demonstrate that superficial squamous cell carcinoma of the feline nasal planum responds excellently to (90)Strontium plesiotherapy, and this form of therapy may offer advantages over other alternatives currently available."

    "abstract": "Principles of fragment-based molecular design are presented and discussed in the context of de novo drug design. The underlying idea is to dissect known drug molecules in fragments by straightforward pseudo-retro-synthesis. The resulting building blocks are then used for automated assembly of new molecules. A particular question has been whether this approach is actually able to perform scaffold-hopping. A prospective case study illustrates the usefulness of fragment-based de novo design for finding new scaffolds. We were able to identify a novel ligand disrupting the interaction between the Tat peptide and TAR RNA, which is part of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) mRNA. Using a single template structure (acetylpromazine) as reference molecule and a topological pharmacophore descriptor (CATS), new chemotypes were automatically generated by our de novo design software Flux. Flux features an evolutionary algorithm for fragment-based compound assembly and optimization. Pharmacophore superimposition and docking into the target RNA suggest perfect matching between the template molecule and the designed compound. Chemical synthesis was straightforward, and bioactivity of the designed molecule was confirmed in a FRET assay. This study demonstrates the practicability of de novo design to generating RNA ligands containing novel molecular scaffolds."

    "abstract": "The diet of feral cats (Felis catus) inhabiting a regional rubbish tip ( dump) in Victoria was studied to determine whether cats utilised garbage or live prey from the surrounding heathlands for food. Between 30 and 50 cat scats were collected from the tip over two years in each of four sampling periods: spring 1997, autumn 1998, spring 1998 and autumn 1999. The scats were analysed to determine major dietary components, dietary breadth and seasonal overlap of diet. Bone fragments from meat scraps were the most frequent dietary item detected in the scats. Vertebrate prey species occurred less often in the cats' diet but a variety of both introduced and native species were represented. Analysis of dietary breadth confirmed that cats selected mainly meat and chicken scraps from the garbage but indicated that vertebrates were hunted opportunistically. Control measures are suggested to reduce cat numbers at regional rubbish tips to relieve potential impact on native wildlife."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The benefits of endoscopic assistance to remove intracranial tumors in small animals are not described. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic-assisted intracranial tumor removal in dogs and cats. ANIMALS: Thirty-three dogs and 6 cats with intracranial tumors. METHODS: Retrospective study. CBC, serum chemistry profile, coagulation testing, blood typing, and systemic tumor staging, which included 3-view thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound examination, were performed to detect other significant underlying disease in preparation of the animal for surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in 37/39 cases to image the brain tumor. Surgical approach was dictated by the location of the tumor. Histopathologic examination of the tumor tissue was performed in all cases. Animals were followed throughout their postoperative course for complications and survival times. Statistical analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves) was performed to obtain median survival times in dogs with meningiomas. RESULTS: Use of an endoscope resulted in visualization of residual tumor and potentially more complete removal of the brain tumors. There were no clinically important complications associated with the use of the endoscope. Median survival time was 2,104 days for dogs with forebrain meningiomas surgically removed with endoscopic assistance and 702 days for dogs with caudal brain meningiomas. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These results demonstrate that the use of an endoscope to assist in brain tumor removal is apparently safe and might result in improved survival times."

    "abstract": "A human isolate of Nipah virus from an outbreak of febrile encephalitis in Malaysia that coincided with a field outbreak of disease in pigs was used to infect eight 6-week-old pigs orally or subcutaneously and two cats oronasally. In pigs, the virus induced a respiratory and neurological syndrome consistent with that observed in the Malaysian pigs. Not all the pigs showed clinical signs, but Nipah virus was recovered from the nose and oropharynx of both clinically and sub-clinically infected animals. Natural infection of in-contact pigs, which was readily demonstrated, appeared to be acute and self-limiting. Subclinical infections occurred in both inoculated and in-contact pigs. Respiratory and neurological disease was also produced in the cats, with recovery of virus from urine as well as from the oropharynx. The clinical and pathological syndrome induced by Nipah virus in cats was comparable with that associated with Hendra virus infection in this species, except that in fatal infection with Nipah virus there was extensive inflammation of the respiratory epithelium, associated with the presence of viral antigen. Viral shedding via the nasopharynx, as observed in pigs and cats in the present study, was not a regular feature of earlier reports of experimental Hendra virus infection in cats and horses. The findings indicate the possibility of field transmission of Nipah virus between pigs via respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions."

    "abstract": "Objective—To determine sensitivity and specificity of radiography, ultrasonography, and antegrade pyelogra- phy for detection of ureteral obstructions in cats. Design—Retrospective study. Animals—11 cats. Procedure—Medical records of cats that had radiog- raphy, ultrasonography, and antegrade pyelography performed for suspected ureteral obstructions were examined. Ultrasound-guided pyelocentesis and fluo- roscopic-assisted antegrade pyelography were per- formed on 18 kidneys in 11 cats. Obstructive ureteral lesions were confirmed in all cats by surgical or necropsy examination. Sensitivity and specificity of survey radiography, ultrasonography, and antegrade pyelography for identification of ureteral obstructions were calculated. Surgical or necropsy findings were used as the standard for comparison. Results—All cats were azotemic. Mean ± SD serum creatinine and BUN concentrations were 10.2 ± 6.1 and 149 ± 82 mg/dL, respectively. Fifteen of 18 ureters were found to be obstructed at surgery or necropsy. Sensitivity and specificity were 60 and 100% for radiography and 100 and 33% for ultra- sonography, respectively, in identification of ureteral obstructions. Leakage of contrast material developed in 8 of 18 kidneys during antegrade pyelography and prevented diagnostic interpretation in 5 of 18 studies. For the 13 diagnostic studies, specificity and sensitiv- ity were 100% by use of the antegrade pyelography technique. Correct identification of the anatomic loca- tion of the ureteral obstruction was obtained in 100% of diagnostic antegrade pyelography studies and in 60% of radiography or ultrasonography studies. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Antegrade pyelography can be a useful alternative in the diagno- sis and localization of ureteral obstructions in azotemic cats, although leakage of contrast material may prevent interpretation of the study."

Search behavior in cats and dogs: interspecific differences in working memory and spatial cognition. Animal Learning & Behavior 24, 142-149; Miller, H., Gipson, C., Vaughan, A., Rayburn-Reeves, R., Zentall, T.R., 2009. Object permanence in dogs: invisible displacement in a rotation task. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review 16 (1), 150-155]. For example, when an object is placed inside an occluder, one of which was attached to each end of a beam that could be rotated 90 degrees , dogs search inside of the appropriate occluder. The current research confirmed this finding and tested the possibility that the dogs were using a perceptual/conditioning mechanism (i.e., their gaze was drawn to the occluder as the object was placed inside and they continued looking at it as it rotated). The test was done by introducing a delay between the displacement of the object and the initiation of the dogs' search. In Experiment 1, during the delay, a barrier was placed between the dog and the apparatus. In Experiment 2, the lights were turned off during the delay. The search accuracy for some dogs was strongly affected by the delay, however, search accuracy for other dogs was not affected. These results suggest that although a perceptual/conditioning mechanism may be involved for some dogs, it cannot account for the performance of others. It is likely that these other dogs showed true object permanence."

The signs with highest predictive value for nasal neoplasia were displacement of midline structures (73%), unilateral generalised soft tissue opacity (70%), unilateral generalised loss of turbinate detail (69%) and evidence of bone invasion (64%). The only radiographic finding that occurred more frequently in cats with rhinitis was a nasal cavity within normal limits, and the predictive value of this sign was only 38%. Radiographic signs in cats with nasal neoplasia are similar to those reported in dogs, whereas the radiographic signs in cats with rhinitis are variable and non-specific, and may be absent."

    "abstract": "Objectives of this study were to determine prevalence of infection in feral cats in Northern Florida with a select group of infectious organisms and to determine risk factors for infection. Blood samples or sera from 553 cats were tested with a panel of antibody, antigen or PCR assays. Mate cats were at higher risk for FIV, Mycoplasma haemofelis, and A haemominutum. Infection with either FeLV or FIV was associated with increased risk for coinfection with the other retrovirus, A haemofelis, or M. haemominutum. Bartonella henselae had the highest prevalence and was the only organism that did not have any associated risk for coinfection with other organisms. Feral cats in this study had similar or lower prevalence rates of infections than those published for pet cats in the United States. Thus, feral cats assessed in this study appear to be of no greater risk to human beings or other cats than pet cats. (C) 2003 ESFM and AAFP. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "abstract": "Objective - To evaluate the effect of renal autograft ischemia and reperfusion associated with renal transplantation on pulse rate and pressure and arterial blood pressure variables in clinically normal cats. Animals - 10 cats. Procedures - A radiotelemetric implant was placed in each cat to measure hemodynamic variables; baseline data were recorded before surgery. Standard heterotopic renal implantation and contralateral nephrectomy were performed (day 0). Autografts were stored in cold sucrose phosphate solution for 30 minutes (n = 5) or 3 hours (5); cats were anephric during this period. Hemodynamic variables were recorded every 5 minutes for up to 16 days after surgery; mean daily values were calculated. Results - Data from 6 cats were available for analysis. Two cats developed ureteral obstructions and became azotemic at 111 and 197 hours after kidney reperfusion. Mean serum creatinine and BUN concentrations were greater than baseline values on days 1 and 2. Although changes from baseline hemodynamic values were detected in some cats, arterial blood pressure measurements did not change significantly from baseline at any time point. Compared with baseline data, mean pulse rate was increased on days 1 and 2 and days 6 through 12; mean pulse pressure was increased on days 1 and 2. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - In clinically normal cats, hypertension was not induced by clinically relevant periods of ischemia-reperfusion injury of renal autografts and was not an inherent consequence of the transplantation process. Causes of marked posttransplantation hypertension in cats with chronic kidney disease require further investigation."

    "abstract": "Sensory stimuli entering the nervous system follow particular paths of processing, typically separated (segregated) from the paths of other modal information. However, sensory perception, awareness and cognition emerge from the combination of information (integration). The corticocortical networks of cats and macaque monkeys display three prominent characteristics: (i) modular organisation (facilitating the segregation), (ii) abundant alternative processing paths and (iii) the presence of highly connected hubs. Here, we study in detail the organisation and potential function of the cortical hubs by graph analysis and information theoretical methods. We find that the cortical hubs form a spatially delocalised, but topologically central module with the capacity to integrate multisensory information in a collaborative manner. With this, we resolve the underlying anatomical substrate that supports the simultaneous capacity of the cortex to segregate and to integrate multisensory information."

    "abstract": "In humans the dural tail is a sign seen on contrast enhanced T1 weighted magnetic resonance images. This finding is considered specific for meningioma. The purpose of this study was to determine how often the dural tail occurs in cats and dogs and whether it is a specific sign for meningiomas in these species. MR examinations for eighteen dogs and four cats with proven diagnoses were reviewed. Diagnoses included ten meningiomas (seven dogs and three cats), three gliomas, two pituitary tumors, single examples of two other tumor types and five patients with mass lesions due to inflammatory disease. Contrast enhanced T1 weighted images were evaluated independently by three of the authors for the presence of a dural tail, without knowledge of the diagnoses. The results were compared to the diagnosis for each patient and the performance of individual reviewers compared. When their results were averaged, the reviewers reported the presence of a dural tail in 6 of 10 (60%) meningiomas, although detection varied between observers from 40% to 80%. Each reviewer had one false positive result, two reported a dural tail with a chromophobe adenocarcinoma and one with a toxoplasma meningoencephalitis. When a dural tail is seen an associated mass is most likely a meningioma. It is uncertain whether the dural tail represents neoplastic infiltration beyond the margins of the meningioma. This should be considered when planning treatment."

    "abstract": "We have studied the spatiotemporal receptive-field organization of 144 neurons recorded from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of adult cats and kittens at 4 and 8 wk postnatal. Receptive-field profiles were obtained with the use of a reverse correlation technique, in which we compute the cross-correlation between the action potential train of a neuron and a randomized sequence of long bright and dark bar stimuli that are flashed throughout the receptive field. Spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles of LGN neurons generally exhibit a biphasic temporal response, as well as the classical center-surround spatial organization. For nonlagged cells, the first temporal phase of the response dominates, whereas for lagged neurons, the second temporal phase of the response is typically the largest. This temporal phase difference between lagged and nonlagged cells accounts for their divergent behavior in response to flashed stimuli. Most LGN cells exhibit some degree of space-time inseparability, which means that the receptive field cannot simply be viewed as the product of a spatial waveform and a temporal waveform. In these cases, the response of the surround is typically delayed relative to that of the center, and there is some blending of center and surround during the time course of the response. We demonstrate that a simple extension of the traditional difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) model, in which the surround response is delayed relative to that of the center, accounts nicely for these findings. With regard to development, our analysis shows that spatial and temporal aspects of receptive field structure mature with markedly different time courses. After 4 wk postnatal, there is little change in the spatial organization of LGN receptive fields, with the exception of a weak, but significant, trend for the surround to become smaller and stronger with age. In contrast, there are substantial changes in temporal receptive-field structure after 4 wk postnatal. From 4 to 8 wk postnatal, the shape of the temporal response profile changes, becoming more biphasic, but the latency and duration of the response remain unchanged. From 8 wk postnatal to adulthood, the shape of the temporal profile remains approximately constant, but there is a dramatic decline in both the latency and duration of the response. Comparison of our results with recent data from cortical (area 17) simple cells reveals that the temporal development of LGN cells accounts for a substantial portion of the temporal maturation of simple cells."

    "abstract": "Histoplasma capsulatum is endemic throughout most of the United States with a high prevalence of infections in the Midwest and South. Histoplasmosis is the second most common systemic fungal disease in cats that may be more susceptible than dogs. Infection occurs by inhalation of conidia from the mycelial phase, which subsequently convert to the yeast form. Histoplasma capsulatum is phagocytized and harbored by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Infection may be subclinical or cause clinical pulmonary granulomatous disease or dissemination. Disseminated disease predominantly affects the liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, bone and bone marrow, integument, and eyes. Primary gastrointestinal histoplasmosis also occurs. Clinical signs of histoplasmosis often are nonspecific, including chronic wasting, fever, anorexia, respiratory signs, and lameness. Gastrointestinal signs (eg, diarrhea with hematochezia or melena) are common in dogs. The definitive diagnosis is made by identification of the yeast in tissue samples. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice."

The QoL scores prior to the onset of cancer (mean 9.5, range 6-10) were significantly higher than the ratings given after the onset of cancer but before commencement of chemotherapy (mean 3.9, range 1-9.4). The QoL scores during chemotherapy (mean 6.3, range 1-10) were also significantly lower than prior to the onset of cancer, but significantly higher during treatment than prior to starting treatment. Adverse effects were experienced by 27 (87%) cats during the course of chemotherapy. Twenty-five (83%) of clients were happy they treated their cat and 27 owners (87%) would treat another cat. The results suggest that COP chemotherapy is perceived by owners to be tolerated by cats."

    "abstract": "The surgical technique for removal of tentorial meningiomas is described on six cats using a unilateral temporal supracerebellar transtentorial approach. Complete gross tumour resection was achieved in four of six cats. In one cat, only subtotal resection was achieved. One cat died shortly after surgery because of extensive cerebral haemorrhage. The surgical approach, combined with cisternal or ventricular cerebrospinal fluid puncture and an open-window technique (tumour fenestration and enucleation) provided sufficient visibility and tumour accessibility without excessive manipulation of the brain parenchyma. In all patients, a postoperative transient worsening of the clinical signs was observed. The neurological signs resolved with time with the exception of blindness in two cats. All five surviving cats were monitored for a mean follow-up time of 19 months (median 20 months; range 6-30 months). All patients died or were euthanased because of tumour regrowth within the follow-up period. Although challenging, surgical treatment is a useful therapeutic measure in the treatment of cats presenting with tentorial meningiomas."

    "abstract": "Whether in an ocean reef, a landfill, or a gastrointestinal tract (GIT), invisible communities of highly active and adaptable microbes prosper. Over time, mammals have developed a symbiosis with microbes that are important inhabitants not only in the GIT, but also in the mouth, skin, and urogenital tract. In the GIT, the number of commensal microbes exceeds the total number of host cells by at least 10 times. The GIT microbes play a critical role in nutritional, developmental, defensive, and physiologic processes in the host. Recent evidence also suggests a role of GIT microbes in metabolic phenotype and disease risk (e.g., obesity, metabolic syndrome) of the host. Proper balance is a key to maintaining GIT health. Balanced microbial colonization is also important for other body regions such as the oral cavity, the region with the greatest prevalence of disease in dogs and cats. A significant obstruction to studying microbial populations has been the lack of tools to identify and quantify microbial communities accurately and efficiently. Most of the current knowledge of microbial populations has been established by traditional cultivation methods that are not only laborious, time-consuming, and often inaccurate, but also greatly limited in scope. However, recent advances in molecular-based techniques have resulted in a dramatic improvement in studying microbial communities. These DNA-based high-throughput technologies have enabled us to more clearly characterize the identity and metabolic activity of microbes living in the host and their association with health and diseases. Despite this recent progress, however, published data pertaining to microbial communities of dogs and cats are still lacking in comparison with data in humans and other animals. More research is required to provide a more detailed description of the canine and feline microbiome and its role in health and disease."

Design-Cross-sectional survey. Sample Population-294 adult residents of Cayucos, Los Osos, and Morro Bay, Calif. Procedures-Telephone survey Results-The region's cat population was estimated at 7,284 owned and 2,046 feral cats, and 38% of surveyed households owned a mean of 1.9 cats/household. Forty-four percent of cats defecated outside > 75% of the time. Annual fecal deposition (wet weight) by owned cats in the 3 communities was estimated to be 776 tonnes (76.4 tons). Cat owners were more likely to oppose cat licensing and impounding stray cats and support trap-neuter-return for stray cats and less likely to be concerned about water pollution, than were noncat owners. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Feral cats represented a sizeable proportion (22%) of the free-roaming cats in this area and could be contributing 30.0 tonnes (29.5 tons) of feces to the environment per year. However, feral cats are not the principal source of fecal loading because owned cats defecating outdoors contribute an estimated 776 tonnes (76.4 tons) or 72% of the annual outdoor fecal deposition."

    "abstract": "Multi-site field potential and intracellular recordings from various neocortical areas were used to study very fast oscillations or ripples (80-200 Hz) during electrographic seizures in cats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. The animals displayed spontaneously occurring and electrically induced seizures comprising spike-wave complexes (2-3 Hz) and fast runs (10-20 Hz). Neocortical ripples had much higher amplitudes during seizures than during the slow oscillation preceding the onset of seizures. A series of experimental data from the present study supports the hypothesis that ripples are implicated in seizure initiation. Ripples were particularly strong at the onset of seizures and halothane, which antagonizes the occurrence of ripples, also blocked seizures. The firing of electrophysiologically defined cellular types was phase-locked with ripples in simultaneously recorded field potentials. This indicates that ripples during paroxysmal events are associated with a coordination of firing in a majority of neocortical neurons. This was confirmed with dual intracellular recordings. Based on the amplitude that neocortical ripples reach during paroxysmal events, we propose a mechanism by which neocortical ripples during normal network activity could actively participate in the initiation of seizures on reaching a certain threshold amplitude. This mechanism involves a vicious feedback loop in which very fast oscillations in field potentials are a reflection of synchronous action potentials, and in turn these oscillations help generate and synchronize action potentials in adjacent neurons through electrical interactions."

To explore its neuronal basis, we trained monkeys to categorize computer-generated stimuli as \"cats\" and \"dogs.\" A morphing system was used to systematically vary stimulus shape and precisely define a category boundary. Psychophysical testing and analysis of eye movements suggest that the monkeys categorized the stimuli by attending to multiple stimulus features. Neuronal activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex reflected the category of visual stimuli and changed with learning when a monkey was retrained with the same stimuli assigned to new categories. Further, many neurons showed activity that appeared to reflect the monkey's decision about whether two stimuli were from the same category or not. These results suggest that the lateral prefrontal cortex is an important part of the neuronal circuitry underlying category learning and category-based behaviors."

In this report, we describe the successful application of this functional proteomics approach to compare protein expression levels in visual cortical area 17 of adult cats and 30-day-old kittens, in order to identify proteins expressed in an age-related fashion. We identified 16 proteins that were more abundantly expressed in kitten striate cortex and 12 proteins with a pronounced expression in adult cat area 17. Among those isolated from kitten area 17 were proteins related to axon growth and growth cone guidance and to the formation of cytoskeletal filaments. Glial fibrillary acidic protein, as identified in adult cat area 17, has been implicated previously in the termination of the critical period for cortical plasticity in kittens. In situ hybridization experiments for two of the identified proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein and collapsin response mediator protein 5, confirmed and extended their differential expression to the mRNA level. Our findings show that two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry is a powerful approach that permits the identification of small protein expression differences correlated to different physiological conditions."

    "abstract": "The origin of orientation selectivity in visual cortical responses is a central problem for understanding cerebral cortical circuitry. In cats, many experiments suggest that orientation selectivity arises from the arrangement of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferents to layer 4 simple cells. However, this explanation is not sufficient to account for the contrast invariance of orientation tuning. To understand contrast invariance, we first characterize the input to cat simple cells generated by the oriented arrangement of LGN afferents. We demonstrate that it has two components: a spatial-phase-specific component (i.e., one that depends on receptive field spatial phase), which is tuned for orientation, and a phase-nonspecific component, which is untuned. Both components grow with contrast. Second, we show that a correlation-based intracortical circuit, in which connectivity between cell pairs is determined by the correlation of their LGN inputs, is sufficient to achieve well tuned, contrast-invariant orientation tuning. This circuit generates both spatially opponent, \"antiphase\" inhibition (\"push-pull\"), and spatially matched, \"same-phase\" excitation. The inhibition, if sufficiently strong, suppresses the untuned input component and sharpens responses to the tuned component at all contrasts. The excitation amplifies tuned responses. This circuit agrees with experimental evidence showing spatial opponency between, and similar orientation tuning of, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs received by a simple cell. Orientation tuning is primarily input driven, accounting for the observed invariance of tuning width after removal of intracortical synaptic input, as well as for the dependence of orientation tuning on stimulus spatial frequency. The model differs from previous push-pull models in requiring dominant rather than balanced inhibition and in predicting that a population of layer 4 inhibitory neurons should respond in a contrast-dependent manner to stimuli of all orientations, although their tuning width may be similar to that of excitatory neurons. The model demonstrates that fundamental response properties of cortical layer 4 can be explained by circuitry expected to develop under correlation-based rules of synaptic plasticity, and shows how such circuitry allows the cortex to distinguish stimulus intensity from stimulus form."

    "abstract": "Records of 127 cats with arterial thromboembolism (ATE) were reviewed. Abyssinian, Birman, Ragdoll, and male cats were overrepresented. Tachypnea (91%), hypothermia (66%), and absent limb motor function (66%) were common. Of 90 cats with diagnostics performed, underlying diseases were hyperthyroidism (12), cardiomyopathy (dilated [8], unclassified [33], hypertrophic obstructive [5], hypertrophic [19]), neoplasia (6), other (4), and none (3). Common abnormalities were left atrial enlargement (93%), congestive heart failure (CHF, 44%), and arrhythmias (44%). Of cats without CHF, 89% were tachypneic. Common biochemical abnormalities were hyperglycemia, azotemia, and abnormally high serum concentrations of muscle enzymes. Of 87 cats treated for acute limb ATE, 39 (45%) survived to be discharged. Significant differences were found between survivors and nonsurvivors for temperature (P < .00001), heart rate (P = .038), serum phosphorus concentration (P = .024), motor function (P = .008), and number of limbs affected (P = .001). No significant difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors when compared by age, respiratory rate, other biochemical analytes, or concurrent CHE A logistic regression model based on rectal temperature predicted a 50% probability of survival at 98.9 degrees F (37.2 degrees C). Median survival time (MST) for discharged cats was 117 days. Eleven cats had ATE recurrences, and 5 cats developed limb problems. Cats with CHF (MST: 77 days) had significantly shorter survival than cats without CHF (MST: 223 days; P = .016). No significant difference was found in survival or recurrence rate between cats receiving high-dose aspirin (> or = 40 mg/cat q72h) and cats receiving low-dose aspirin (5 mg/cat q72h). Adverse effects were less frequent and milder for the lower dosage."

    "abstract": "We report feeding studies on adult domestic cats designed to disentangle the complex interactions among dietary protein, fat and carbohydrate in the control of intake. Using geometric techniques that combine mixture triangles and intake plots from the geometric framework, we: (1) demonstrate that cats balance their macronutrient intake, (2) estimate the composition of the target balance and (3) reveal the priorities given to different macronutrients under dietary conditions where the target is unachievable. Our analysis indicates that cats have a ceiling for carbohydrate intake, which limits ingestion and constrains them to deficits in protein and fat intake (relative to their target) on high-carbohydrate foods. Finally, we reanalyse data from a previous experiment that claimed that kittens failed to regulate protein intake, and show that, in fact, they did. These results not only add to the growing appreciation that carnivores, like herbivores and omnivores, regulate macronutrient intake, they also have important implications for designing feeding regimens for companion animals."

There are many reasons for this increase in both species; for cats, the main problems are unlimited access to a nutrient-dense diet and sedentary life style. Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes whose prevalence has increased concomitantly. Cats develop a form of diabetes that is similar to type 2 in humans, characterized by islet amyloid and loss of beta-cell mass. The energy metabolism of cats and the pathophysiology of obesity and diabetes are being characterized in order to identify similarities and differences from humans and to recognize causative and protective factors for adverse sequelae to obesity and diabetes."

    "abstract": "Overview: Avian influenza is a disease of birds, caused by a type A influenza virus. The subtype H5N1 avian influenza occurs primarily in birds and infection varies from mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza). It is extremely rare for cats to be infected and there are only very few confirmed reports of the disease in cats in Europe. Infection: Cats can be infected via the respiratory and oral routes (eg, by eating infected birds). The key precondition for infection is that the cat lives in an area where H5N1 virus infection has been confirmed in birds. Additionally, the cat should have had outdoor access to an environment where waterfowl is present, or contact with poultry or uncooked poultry meat, or close contact with an H5N1-infected, sick cat during the first week of infection. Clinical suspicion: Clinical signs in cats may include fever, lethargy, dyspnoea, conjunctivitis and rapid death. Neurological signs (circling, ataxia) have also been recorded. Diagnosis: The veterinary authorities should be notified. Oropharyngeal, nasal and/or rectal swabs or faecal samples of suspected cases should be submitted for PCR and/or virus isolation. Post-mortem samples of lung and mediastinal lymph nodes should be obtained. Particular care should be taken when handling the cat and/or samples. Disease management: The virus is sensitive to all standard medical disinfectants. Cats with suspected H5N1 infection should be kept in strict isolation. Owners should be advised to confine the cat to a separate room prior to bringing it to the veterinary clinic. Vaccination and disease prevention: No H5N1 vaccines are commercially available for cats. In the event of confirmed cases of H5N1 avian influenza in birds in the area, owners should keep their cats indoors until further information is available, and follow official regulations. © 2009 ESFM and AAFP."

    "abstract": "Because oxygen and carbon dioxide are very soluble in certain silicone oils and fluorocarbon liquids, these liquids will support respiration of mammals. Mice and cats respiring silicone oil die shortly after return to air breathing, while those breathing fluorocarbon survive for weeks. The respiration of mice is optimally supported by these organic liquids at about 20°C. In cats, arterial oxygenation is excellent, but there is some impairment of carbon dioxide elimination. All animals have suffered some pulmonary damage from breathing fluorocarbon liquids. Continued investigation of organic fluid respiration may lead to development of a safe method to support the respiration of man by liquids equilibrated with gases at atmospheric pressure."

    "abstract": "In the previous paper we have demonstrated, by means of field potential and extracellular unit recordings, that bicuculline-induced seizures, which include spike-wave (SW) or polyspike-wave (PSW) complexes, are initiated intracortically and survive ipsilateral thalamectomy. Here, we used multisite field potential and extracellular recordings to validate the patterns of cortical SW/PSW seizures in chronically implanted, behaving cats. To investigate the cellular patterns and excitability during spontaneously occurring and electrically elicited cortical seizures, we used single and dual intracellular recordings from regular-spiking (RS) and fast-rhythmic-bursting (FRB) cortical neurons, in conjunction with field potential recordings from neocortex and related thalamic nuclei, in cats maintained under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. 1) Invariably, the spontaneous or electrically induced seizures were initiated within the cortex of both behaving and anesthetized animals. Spontaneously occurring, compound seizures consisting of SW/PSW complexes at 2-4 Hz and fast runs at 10-15 Hz, developed without discontinuity from the slow (mainly 0.5-0.9 Hz), sleeplike, cortically generated oscillation. 2) During SW/PSW complexes, RS neurons discharged spike trains during the depth-negative component of the cortical \"spike\" component of field potentials and were hyperpolarized during the depth-positive field wave. The FRB neurons fired many more action potentials than RS cells during SW/PSW complexes. Averaged activities triggered by the spiky field potentials or by the steepest slope of depolarization in cortical neurons demonstrated similar relations between intracellular activities and field potentials during sleep and seizure epochs, the latter-being an exaggeration of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components of the slow sleep oscillation. 3) During the fast runs, RS cells were tonically depolarized and discharged single action potentials or spike doublets (usually with pronounced spike inactivation), whereas FRB cells discharged rhythmic spike bursts, time locked with the depth-negative field potentials. 4) Neuronal excitability, tested by depolarizing current pulses applied throughout the seizures and compared with pre- and postseizure epochs, showed a decreased number of evoked action potentials during both seizure components (SW/PSW complexes and fast runs), eventually leading to null responses during the postictal depression. 5) Data suggest that interconnected FRB neurons may play an important role in the initiation of cortical seizures. We discuss the similarities between the electrographic patterns described in this study and those found in different forms of clinical seizures."

Cases included eight cats with feline infectious peritonitis and two cats with toxoplasmosis. Abnormalities affecting the CNS were observed in MR images in 10 (71%) cats. Intracranial lesions appeared as slightly hypointense foci in T1-weighted images in two (14%) cats, as hyperintense foci in T2-weighted images in seven (50%) cats and as hyperintense foci after intravenous administration of a gadolinium-based contrast medium in 10 (71%) cats. In six cats with lesions in T1- and/or T2-weighted images, additional lesions were visible in T1-weighted images obtained after gadolinium-based contrast medium administration. In three cats, lesions were visible only after contrast medium administration. In our study, MR imaging (MRI) did not appear to detect all cases of CNS inflammation in the population of cats with inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, MRI adds information about the sites and morphology of intracranial lesions that should help to distinguish between neoplasia and inflammatory conditions and, possibly, between different inflammatory conditions."

    "abstract": "The effects of transitions from air-breathing to hyperoxia (100% O2), and the reverse, on respiration (phrenic activity) and on medullary extracellular fluid (ECF) pH, or hydrogen ion concentration [H+], were studied in 8 anesthetized, paralyzed, vagotomized and glomectomized cats whose end-tidal PCO2 was kept constant. The transition from air to hyperoxia (7 cats) led to a small (1.23 nmol/L [H+], 0.010 pH unit) acidic shift of medullary ECF and a 24% increase of neural tidal and minute respiratory activity with no significant change of frequency. Opposite changes of approximately equal magnitude followed the transition from hyperoxia to air (8 cats). We show that the slopes of the respiratory responses to changing ECF [H+] in the present study are not different than the slopes with CO2-induced changes of ECF [H+] in 25 other cats. Our findings indicate that most, if not all, of the respiratory increase after hyperoxia is due to accumulation of CO2 and H+ in medullary ECF that act on the central chemoreceptors. We suggest that decreased medullary blood flow and the Haldane effect are the main mechanisms causing the rise of medullary PCO2 and stimulation of breathing"

    "abstract": "More than two-thirds of cropland in the United States is devoted to the production of just four crop species-maize, wheat, soybeans, and cotton-raising concerns that homogenization of the American agricultural landscape could facilitate widespread disease and pest outbreaks, compromising the national food supply. As a new component in national agricultural risk assessment, we employed a graph-theoretic approach to examine the connectivity of these crops across the United States. We used county crop acreage to evaluate the landscape resistance to transrnission-the degree to which host availability limits spread in any given region-for pests or pathogens dependent on each crop. For organisms that cats disperse under conditions of lower host availability, maize and soybean are highly connected at a national scale, compared with the more discrete regions of wheat and cotton production. Determining the scales at which connectivity becomes disrupted for organisms with different dispersal abilities may help target rapid-response regions and the development of strategic policies to enhance agricultural landscape heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "Renal diseases are common in dogs and cats. Renal biopsy may be required during the evaluation of the patient to establish a definitive diagnosis, determine the severity of the lesion and formulate an optimal treatment plan. Renal biopsy specimens can be collected via several methods. Percutaneous techniques are performed with ultrasound guidance in both dogs and cats or blindly in cats. If ultrasound guidance is not available, the keyhole technique can be used in dogs. Biopsy can also be performed using laparoscopy or surgery. While complications can arise with any of these techniques, complications are less frequent when an experienced operator uses proper technique. Renal biopsy specimens must be processed and evaluated appropriately if consistent and accurate diagnoses are to be rendered. The article summarizes patient selection and evaluation, renal biopsy techniques, expected complications of renal biopsy, and appropriate processing and evaluation of the renal biopsy specimen."

    "abstract": "A cross-sectional survey was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Echinococcus multilocularis and E. granulosus infections in domestic dogs and cats from Germany and other European countries. Faecal samples of 21,588 dogs and 10,650 cats routinely submitted to a private veterinary laboratory between June 2004 and June 2005 were examined using the ZnSO(4)-NaCl flotation method. Taeniid eggs were detected in 54 (0.25%) and 37 (0.34%) of the canine and feline faecal samples, respectively. Taeniid eggs were separated and subjected to a DNA preparation and a modified two-step PCR for the detection of Echinococcus spp. based on mitochondrial 12S rRNA genes. PCR products from Echinococcus-negative but cestode-positive reactions were cloned and sequenced to determine the Taenia species. E. multilocularis DNA was specifically amplified in 43 (0.24%) and 25 (0.23%) of the samples from dogs and cats, respectively. E. granulosus DNA was not detected in any sample, while, E. multilocularis-positive samples were detected in dogs from Germany only, those of cats originated from Germany, Denmark and The Netherlands. The prevalence of E. multilocularis egg-positive canine samples was significantly higher in southern (0.35%) than in northern Germany (0.13%). In contrast, no significant regional difference was observed in cats from Germany. Taeniid eggs from Echinococcus-negative samples and from a few samples with macroscopically detected Taenia sp. proglottids were identified as eggs of T. crassiceps (n=8), T. martis, T. serialis, T. polyacantha, T. taeniaeformis and T. pisiformis in dogs (n=1 of each) and T. taeniaeformis (n=11) in cats. The spectrum of cestodes detected in domestic dogs and cats indicate the consumption of small rodents as infection source. The high proportion of E. multilocularis-positive samples, suggest domestic dogs and cats as a possible source of E. multilocularis infection for humans."

    "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipokine that is specifically expressed in adipose tissues, directly sensitizes the body to insulin via specific receptors and its decreased plasma concentration is responsible for insulin resistance in obese humans. Diabetes is an important problem also in veterinary medicine, and feline diabetes is very similar to human type 2 diabetes, in which obesity is an important risk factor. In the present study, We obtained cDNA clones corresponding to feline adiponectin and adiponectin receptor 1 (AD-R1), whose nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were highly identical to those of other species, especially, the extra-cellular domain of feline AD-R1 was almost identical to that of human AD-R1. Adiponectin mRNA was exclusively detected in the adipose tissue, but AD-R1 was in all tissues tested in this study. Next, plasma samples were collected from 22 cats visiting veterinary practices. They were divided to 2 groups based on a five-point scale body condition score (BCS), such as normal group (BCS ranged from 2.5 through 3.5) and obese group (BCS ranged from 4.0 through 5.0). Plasma adiponectin in obese cats (7.2 +/- 1.5 microg/ml) was significantly lower than that of normal cats (18.0 +/- 3.2 microg/ml). These results suggest that adiponectin may be responsible for insulin function also in the cat, and it can be a target molecule for treatment of obesity and diabetes in cats."

    "abstract": "Precise spatial and temporal control of developmental genes is crucial during embryogenesis. Regulatory mutations that cause the misexpression of key developmental genes may underlie a number of developmental abnormalities. The congenital abnormality preaxial polydactyly, extra digits, is an example of this novel class of mutations and is caused by ectopic expression of the signalling molecule Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in the developing limb bud. Mutations in the long-distant, limb-specific cis-regulator for SHH, called the ZRS, are responsible for the ectopic expression which underlies the abnormality. Here, we show that populations of domestic cats which manifest extra digits, including the celebrated polydactylous Hemingway's cats, also contain mutations within the ZRS. The polydactylous cats add significantly to the number of mutations previously reported in mouse and human and to date, all are single nucleotide substitutions. A mouse transgenic assay shows that these single nucleotide substitutions operate as gain-of-function mutations that activate Shh expression at an ectopic embryonic site; and that the sequence context of the mutation is responsible for a variable regulatory output. The plasticity of the regulatory response correlates with both the phenotypic variability and with species differences. The polydactyly mutations define a new genetic mechanism that results in human congenital abnormalities and identifies a pathogenetic mechanism that may underlie other congenital diseases."

    "abstract": "At autopsy of 230 adult stray cats, 120 from backyards and 110 from gardens, the intestinal tract was scrutinized for helminths. The prevalence of Toxocara cati, Taenia taeniaeformis and Dipylidium caninum was found to be 79%, 11% and 14%, respectively. Comparisons were made with the results of previous Danish investigations. The prevalence of Toxocara cati was found to be independent of time of collection and the sex and habitat of the cats and identical in cats with or without Taenia. This indicates that paratenic hosts do not play an important epizootiological role in the transmission of T. cati. The intensity of Toxocara per cat followed a negative binomial pattern. The high prevalence of T. cati combined with most cats having a low wormload shows that the cat population generally possesses a high degree of resistance against superimposed infections. The intensity of male Toxocara increases with the size of the worm population. This we consider to be an expression of increasing susceptibility of the cats. The prevalence of T. taeniaeformis was significantly higher in garden cats, due to their greater opportunity for catching mice. D. caninum, however, was significantly more frequent in backyard cats, probably owing to better living condition for the flea larvae in backyards. For both T. taeniaeformis and D. caninum a higher frequency was found in female cats, which is thought to be associated with their care for the kittens. ?? 1984 Springer-Verlag."

    "abstract": "The apparent conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics remains one of the unresolved mysteries of the physical world. According to recent theories, this conflict results in gravity-induced quantum state reduction of \"Schr\\\"odinger cats\", quantum superpositions of macroscopic observables. In recent years, great progress has been made in cooling micromechanical resonators towards their quantum mechanical ground state. This work is an important step towards the creation of Schr\\\"odinger cats in the laboratory, and the study of their destruction by decoherence. A direct test of the gravity-induced state reduction scenario may therefore be within reach. However, a recent analysis shows that for all systems reported to date, quantum superpositions are destroyed by environmental decoherence long before gravitational state reduction takes effect. Here we report optical trapping of glass microspheres in vacuum with high oscillation frequencies, and cooling of the center-of-mass motion from room temperature to a minimum temperature of 1.5 mK. This new system eliminates the physical contact inherent to clamped cantilevers, and can allow ground-state cooling from room temperature. After cooling, the optical trap can be switched off, allowing a microsphere to undergo free-fall in vacuum. During free-fall, light scattering and other sources of environmental decoherence are absent, so this system is ideal for studying gravitational state reduction. A cooled optically trapped object in vacuum can also be used to search for non-Newtonian gravity forces at small scales, measure the impact of a single air molecule, and even produce Schr\\\"odinger cats of living organisms."

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial DNA of plant and animal cells is a transcriptionally active genome that traces its origins to a symbiotic infection of eucaryotic cells by bacterial progenitors. As prescribed by the Serial Endosymbiosis Theory, symbiotic organelles have gradually transferred their genes to the eucaryotic genome, producing a functional interaction of nuclear and mitochondrial genes in organelle function. We report here a recent remarkable transposition of 7.9 kb of a typically 17.0-kb mitochondrial genome to a specific nuclear chromosomal position in the domestic cat. The intergrated segment has subsequently become amplified 38-76 times and now occurs as a tandem repeat macrosatellite with multiple-length alleles resolved by pulse- field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) segregating in cat populations. Sequence determination of the nuclear mitochondrial DNA segment, Numt, revealed a d(CA)-rich 8-bp motif [ACACACGT] repeated imperfectly five times at the deletion junction that is a likely target for recombination. The extent and pattern of sequence divergence of Numt genes from the cytoplasmic mtDNA homologues plus the occurrence of Numt in other species of the family Felidae allowed an estimate for the origins of Numt at 1.8-2.0 million years ago in an ancestor of four modern species in the genus Felis. Numt genes do not function in cats; rather, the locus combines properties of nuclear minisatellites and pseudogenes. These observations provide an empirical glimpse of historic genomic events that may parallel the accommodation of organelles in eucaryotes."

    "abstract": "A major concern in the use of neural prostheses is whether electrical stimualtion can cause irreversible damage to neurons. The Neural Damage Model was devised to study the problem and to provide guidlines. The cerebral cortex of cats was stimulated continuously for 36 hours with balanced, biphasic waveforms. The charge per phase, charge density and current density were varied in 16 separate tests. Of these stimulus parameters the charge per phase was more closely correlatable with neuronal damage than charge density and current density. Furthermore, the findings in this study suggest that current flow is more important than electrochemical reactions in causing neural damage. Correlation between blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and neuronal damage was valid only in the group of animals sacrificed immediately following stimulation. The BBB is restored within one month following electrical injury. Convulsive seizures occurred in all but one of the animals during electrical stimulation. A technique for localizing the electrode sites at autopsy and in the microscopic sections is described."

In the present study, 170 undergraduates filled out 2 surveys. In the 1st survey, they were asked to rate 28 possible beliefs of a fictitious person described as \"superstitious.\" In the 2nd survey, they were asked to rate their own level of belief for the same items. An analysis revealed several different factors describing different types of beliefs held by the fictitious person. Ratings for the fictitious person were greatest for socially transmitted beliefs (e.g., black cats, rabbits' feet) or idiosyncratic rituals related to luck and chance, followed by belief in the paranormal (e.g., ghosts), spiritualism (e.g., reincarnation), or psi (e.g., telepathy). Religious beliefs were rated as not being descriptive of the fictitious superstitious person. However, an analysis of the participants' own beliefs revealed that those with higher levels of religious belief also tended to be superstitious and believed in the paranormal."

    "abstract": "Domestic cats (Felis catus) received a task in which an obstacle was introduced at the time they were ready to reach for 1 among 2 or 3 baited targets. The results revealed that when the initially chosen direction (i.e., before the introduction of the obstacle) and the new one were orthogonal, the cats reassessed distance, angular deviation, and visibility once they had turned around the obstacle (Experiments 1, 2, and 3). Then the cats chose a different target than the one that would have been chosen had there been no obstacle. When both the initially chosen and the new direction matched (Experiment 4), the cats kept intact their initial decision. The discussion focuses on the nature of the representational system of the cat. The discussion also emphasizes comparisons with dogs (i.e., cooperative hunters).

    "abstract": "In an effort to assess the safety and efficacy of focal intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of cerebral cortex with an array of penetrating electrodes as might be applied to a neuroprosthetic device to aid the deaf or blind, the authors have chronically implanted 3 trained cats in primary auditory cortex with the 100-electrode Utah Intracortical Electrode Array (UIEA). Eleven of the 100 electrodes were hard-wired to a percutaneous connector for chronic access. Prior to implant, cats were trained to “lever-press” in response to pure tone auditory stimulation. After implant, this behavior was transferred to “lever-presses” in response to current injections via single electrodes of the implanted arrays. Psychometric function curves relating injected charge level to the probability of response were obtained for stimulation of 22 separate electrodes in the 3 implanted cats. The average threshold charge/phase required for electrical stimulus detection in each cat was, 8.5, 8.6, and 11.6 nC/phase respectively, with a maximum charge/phase of 26 nC/phase and a minimum of 1.5 nC/phase thresholds were tracked for varying time intervals, and 7 electrodes from 2 cats were tracked for up to 100 days. Electrodes were stimulated for no more than a few minutes each day. Neural recordings taken from the same electrodes before and after multiple electrical stimulation sessions were very similar in signal/noise ratio and in the number of recordable units, suggesting that the range of electrical stimulation levels used did not damage neurons in the vicinity of the electrodes. Although a few early implants failed, the authors conclude that ICMS of cerebral cortex to evoke a behavioral response can be achieved with the penetrating UIEA. Further experiments in support of a sensory cortical prosthesis based on ICMS are warranted"

ANIMALS: 17 cats with seizures. PROCEDURE: Only those cats in which an underlying metabolic abnormality causing the seizures had been identified, diagnostic imaging of the brain and CSF analysis had been done, or a necropsy had been performed were included. Seizures were classified as being a result of metabolic disease, symptomatic epilepsy (ie, epilepsy resulting from a structural lesion of the brain), or probably symptomatic epilepsy (ie, epilepsy without any extracranial or identifiable intracranial disease that is not suspected to be genetic in origin). RESULTS: 3 cats had seizures associated with an underlying metabolic disease (hepatic encephalopathy), 7 had symptomatic epilepsy (3 with neoplasia and 4 with meningoencephalitis), and 7 had probably symptomatic epilepsy. Six of the 7 cats with symptomatic epilepsy died or were euthanatized within 3 months after the diagnosis was made, whereas 6 of the 7 cats with probably symptomatic epilepsy survived for at least 12 months after the diagnosis was made. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that cats with probably symptomatic epilepsy may have a good long-term prognosis."

Thoracic radiographs in all cats were characterized by an increased soft tissue opacity in the cranial mediastinum confirmed to be a cyst by ultrasonography or necropsy. Ultrasonographically cysts appeared as an anechoic mass. A low-cellularity clear fluid was obtained on aspiration. The majority of the cats (n = 8) presented for unrelated conditions with no signs of respiratory distress. No treatment for the cyst was pursued except for drainage during ultrasonographic-guided aspiration in several cats. On follow-up of eight cats, none were symptomatic for the cyst from 3-45 months after diagnosis. Mediastinal cyst should be considered when a cranial mediastinal mass is evident radiographically in an older cat. The majority of feline cranial mediastinal cysts are benign with no need for treatment."

The technique is relatively noninvasive (a few blood or urine samples over 2 wk) and is performed in free living conditions during a period of between 5 and 20 d. This is the first report of the use of the method in three cats and two dogs. The measured energy expenditure during 11 d was 207 +/- 12 and 263 kJ.kg-1.d-1 for cats and dogs, respectively. These values were 30 and 10% lower, respectively, than NRC recommendations for energy requirement (NRC 1985, NRC 1986). The percentage body fat was 23 +/- 5% in the three cats and 35% in the two dogs used in this study. The water output (urine + breath) was 36 +/- 4 ml.kg-1.d-1 for the cats and 60 ml.kg-1.d-1 for the dogs. Of the water output, 23% (cats) and 17% (dogs) was lost as insensible water loss. The precision and accuracy of the method are discussed in relation to the assumptions made with this technique and by comparison with published values."

Ventrodorsal radiographs including the pelvic region were evaluated for radiographic evidence of hip dysplasia. Each radiograph was evaluated independently by three board-certified veterinary radiologists and a consensus normal of dysplastic evaluation was determined. There were 684 cats from 12 breeds. The data derived from this study indicate the frequency of feline hip dysplasia in this population to be about 6.6% (45/684) and that the incidence appears to be breed dependent. Also, the radiographic appearance of hip dysplasia in cats is different than in dogs. A shallow acetabulum with remodeling and proliferation involving the cranio-dorsal acetabular margin were the most common radiographic signs. Minimal remodeling of the femoral neck was seen."

    "abstract": "Domestic cats (Felis catus) have been introduced on many islands in the world and are responsible for much damage to native insular faunas. The worldwide success and spread of this opportunistic predator is generally associated with its trophic adaptability. We examined the diet of a long-established feral cat population on a small Mediterranean island through the analysis of 1,219 scats collected during a 4-year period. Our results confirm that feral cats are generalist predators, able to feed on a wide range of prey. However, only a few prey species formed the major part of its diet. Two introduced mammals and a Mediterranean endemic seabird provided 93% of the yearly biomass consumed by cats (ship rats, 70%; wild rabbits, 7%; and yelkouan shearwaters, 6%). Ship rats remained by far the staple prey for cats throughout the year, but the diet of feral cats was more diversified in spring and early summer, frequently including insects, reptiles, and migrant birds. Endemic yelkouan shearwaters were preyed upon most frequently in autumn and winter, that is, during the shearwaters' prelaying period. Because rats provide the majority of the food of cats, they could help to maintain or inflate this alien predator population with deleterious consequences to the endemic shearwater. A cat eradication campaign would help protect the population of shearwaters on this island."

There is interest by local and national conservation organisations to demarcate protected areas for the iguana in the southern portion of its range. However, no life history information is available for the lizard. In order to provide data that can be applied in a science-based management strategy for the Andros iguana, we investigated seasonal variation in home-range size and habitat selection of the iguana using radio telemetry. Home ranges were the largest reported to date for free-ranging Cyclura iguanas (Fixed 95% Kernel maximums: 30.58 ha for males, 5.63 ha for females). Habitat selection using the Euclidean Distance method revealed that open pine was the only habitat type out of four where iguanas occurred more than expected by chance. However, the pair-wise comparisons of habitat types reveal that iguanas were found significantly closer to open pine and shrubland than to closed pine. We failed to uncover selection of cumulative home-range placement throughout our multi-habitat study areas. Conservation implications of the dynamic seasonal home-range fluctuations and habitat usage are discussed and recommendations are offered for establishing protected areas."

    "abstract": "We present a fast stochastic optimization algorithm for fragment-based molecular de novo design (COLIBREE, Combinatorial Library Breeding). The search strategy is based on a discrete version of particle swarm optimization. Molecules are represented by a scaffold, which remains constant during optimization, and variable linkers and side chains. Different linkers represent virtual chemical reactions. Side-chain building blocks were obtained from pseudo-retrosynthetic dissection of large compound databases. Here, ligand-based design was performed using chemically advanced template search (CATS) topological pharmacophore similarity to reference ligands as fitness function. A weighting scheme was included for particle swarm optimization-based molecular design, which permits the use of many reference ligands and allows for positive and negative design to be performed simultaneously. In a case study, the approach was applied to the de novo design of potential peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor subtype-selective agonists. The results demonstrate the ability of the technique to cope with large combinatorial chemistry spaces and its applicability to focused library design. The technique was able to perform exploitation of a known scheme and at the same time explorative search for novel ligands within the framework of a given molecular core structure. It thereby represents a practical solution for compound screening in the early hit and lead finding phase of a drug discovery project."

    "abstract": "Background: During the last decade, thromboelastography (TEG) has gained increasing acceptance as a diagnostic test in veterinary medicine for evaluation of haemostasis in dogs, however the use of TEG in cats has to date only been described in one previous study and a few abstracts. The objective of the present study was to evaluate and compare three different TEG assays in healthy cats, in order to establish which assay may be best suited for TEG analyses in cats. Methods: 90 TEG analyses were performed on citrated whole blood samples from 15 clinically healthy cats using assays without activator (native) or with human recombinant tissue factor (TF) or kaolin as activators. Results for reaction time (R), clotting time (K), angle ( ), maximum amplitude (MA) and clot lysis (LY30; LY60) were recorded. Results: Coefficients of variation (CVs) were highest in the native assay and comparable in TF and kaolin activated assays. Significant differences were observed between native and kaolin assays for all measured parameters, between kaolin and TF for all measured parameters except LY60 and between native and TF assays for R and K. Conclusion: The results indicate that TEG is a reproducible method for evaluation of haemostasis in clinically healthy cats. However, the three assays cannot be used interchangeably and the kaolin- and TF activated assays have the lowest analytical variation indicating that using an activator may be superior for performing TEG in cats."

    "abstract": "Objective - To evaluate the effect of the duration of cold ischemia on the renin-angiotensin system during renal transplantation in cats and to define the potential influence of vasoactive factors in renal tissue following cold ischemic storage versus warm ischemic storage. Animals - 10 purpose-bred 6-month-old sexually intact female cats. Procedures - 10 cats underwent renal autotransplantation after 30 minutes (n = 5) or 3 hours (5) of simple, ex vivo cold storage of renal autographs. Following autograft reperfusion, direct hemodynamic variables were measured with a telemetric implant and samples were collected for plasma renin concentration. Activation of vascular-related genes (renin, endothelin, and angiotensin converting enzyme) relative to 2-hour simple cold or warm ischemia was also evaluated. Results - No significant difference between groups was detected in any of the hemodynamic variables or postreperfusion plasma renin concentrations measured in this study relative to the duration of cold ischemic storage. There was also no difference between warm- and cold-stored kidneys in the expression of vascular-related genes. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Prolonged renal ischemia for clinically relevant durations does not appear to predispose clinically normal cats to altered hemodynamics or high plasma renin concentrations following graft reperfusion. Activation of vasoactive genes does not appear to be influenced by type of ischemia over 2 hours."

    "abstract": "The emergence of canine parvovirus (CPV) represents a well-documented example highlighting the emergence of a new virus through cross-species transmission. CPV emerged in the mid-1970s as a new pathogen of dogs and has since become endemic in the global dog population. Despite widespread vaccination, CPV has remained a widespread disease of dogs, and new genetic and antigenic variants have arisen and sometimes reached high frequency in certain geographic regions or throughout the world. Here we review our understanding of this emergence event and contrast it to what is known about the emergence of a disease in mink caused by mink enteritis virus (MEV). In addition, we summarize the evolution of CPV over the past 30 years in the global dog population, and describe the epidemiology of contemporary parvovirus infections of dogs and cats. CPV represents a valuable model for understanding disease emergence through cross-species transmission, while MEV provides an interesting comparison."

Findings that may lead to a computed tomographic diagnosis of nasal neoplasia versus rhinitis included osteolysis of the paranasal bones, moderate to severe turbinate destruction, lysis of the nasal septum, the presence of a homogenous space occupying mass, and extension of the disease process into the orbit or facial soft tissues. These findings were not pathognomonic for neoplasia and may be associated with severe rhinitis; therefore, nasal biopsy was recommended. When compared with parallel radiographic studies, computed tomography was not more sensitive than radiographs at detecting the presence of nasal cavity abnormalities in cats with referable clinical signs but was more sensitive at localizing these changes and determining the extent of disease."

    "abstract": "Peer production systems rely on users to self-select appropriate tasks and \"scratch their personal itch\". However, many such systems require significant maintenance work, which also implies the need for collective action, that is, individuals following goals set by the group and performing good citizenship behaviors. How can this paradox be resolved? Here we examine one potential answer: the influence of social identification with the larger group on contributors' behavior. We examine Wikipedia, a highly successful peer production system, and find a significant and growing influence of group structure, with a prevalent example being the WikiProject. Comparison of editors who join projects with those who do not and comparisons of the joiners' behavior before and after they join a project suggest their identification with the group plays an important role in directing them towards group goals and good citizenship behaviors. Upon joining, Wikipedians are more likely to work on project-related content, to shift their contributions towards coordination rather than production work, and to perform maintenance work such as reverting vandalism. These results suggest that group influence can play an important role in maintaining the health of online communities, even when such communities are putatively self-directed peer production systems."

    "abstract": "The neurophysiologic mechanism of ketamine-induced analgesia was studied in cats under conditions of electrolytic decerebration or pentobarbital anesthesia. Injection of bradykinin into the femoral artery served as the noxious stimulus and the neural response in the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord was recorded by the multi-unit activity technique. Ketamine depressed the bradykinin-induced response more markedly in decerebrate, non-anesthetized cats than in pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. The depressant action disappeared following cervical cord transection at C1, in both decerebrate non-anesthetized and pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. Thus the analgesic action of ketamine is probably exerted mainly through activation of the supraspinal pain inhibition system and a direct action on the spinal cord nociceptive neural mechanism, if any, is slight. The excitatory action of ketamine on the supraspinal pain inhibition system is susceptible to the depressant action of pentobarbital."

    "abstract": "Infection by different Leishmania spp. in cats has been reported in many countries. In Spain, since the first Leishmania infection described in 1933, sporadic clinical cases in cats have been reported. Various serologic studies performed in other areas of Spain have shown seroprevalences ranging between 1.7 and 60%. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of leishmaniasis in cats from Central Spain (Madrid), and to assess the existence of associations between Leishmania infantum infection and relevant data obtained from each cat. Two-hundred thirty-three cats attended at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Madrid between September 2005 and June 2006 were tested for L. infantum using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test (cutoff: 1:100) and PCR. PCR testing was performed on the samples to detect Leishmania infection, targeting the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Our results showed a seroprevalence of 1.29% (3/233) using IFA test. Another seven cats were also seroreactive to L. infantum one dilution under the cutoff (1:50). Considering all the seroreactive samples, the percentage of positive animals to L. infantum was 4.29%. Only one of the cats (0.43%) included in the study was PCR-positive. Relative lymphocytosis and an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value were statistically associated with seroreactivity to L. infantum. Our results demonstrate the presence of cats seroreactive to L. infantum in Central Spain, an endemic area for this disease in dogs."

    "abstract": "Stimulation of the pontine micturition center (PMC) results in micturition, i.e. an immediate relaxation of the urethral sphincter and a contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder. The PMC generates the bladder contraction by way of a direct excitatory pathway to the parasympathetic bladder motoneurons in the sacral cord. The idea is that the PMC produces the relaxation of the urethral sphincter via direct projections to GABAergic neurons in the dorsal gray commissure (DGC), which, in turn, inhibit the urethral sphincter motoneurons. According to this hypothesis, electrical stimulation in the DGC in three cats should result in relaxation of the urethral sphincter. The results were in total agreement with this concept. During DGC stimulation a sharp decrease of the urethral pressure was found, the strength of which depended completely on the amplitude of the electrical stimulation."

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring cases of influenza in cats owing to the H5N1 strain have been reported in several countries. A cat reservoir of H5N1 in the United States could provide an environment for zoonotic disease spread to humans. This scenario was the impetus to develop a model to study potential transmission of H5N1 virus in domestic cats utilizing information on cat ownership and cat-cat interaction patterns, in addition to biological properties of the virus. The roaming behaviour of cats significantly influenced epidemic dynamics, as demonstrated by the simulation results from this model. A better understanding of the behaviour of domestic cats and the H5N1 influenza virus can be used to predict epidemic dynamics following the introduction of H5N1 virus into the United States and to develop effective strategies to prevent virus transmission to both cats and humans."

    "abstract": "The transition among hominids from quadrupedalism to bipedalism resulted in modifications in their musculoskeletal morphology. It is unclear, however, whether changes in the circuitry of the CNS were also necessary in order to accommodate the unique balance requirements of two-limb support. This study addresses the issue of modifications in control strategies by investigating the rapid, automatic postural responses of feline and human subjects to sudden disturbances of balance in the anteroposterior (AP) direction while they stand quadrupedally and bipedally on movable platforms. Postural responses are characterized in terms of segmental adjustments, generated AP shear forces, and electromyographic activity. Feline and human subjects correct posture similarly when standing quadrupedally. Furthermore, both species correct stance primarily with their hindlimbs and use their forelimbs as supportive struts. In contrast, both species use completely different correctional strategies when standing bipedally. Morphological restrictions, however, prevent cats from adopting the pillar-like plantigrade posture of human beings. Thus, the correctional strategies of bipedal cats are distinct from those of bipedal human subjects. It is concluded that 1) automatic postural response patterns of quadrupedal Felis and bipedal Homo reflect the different biomechanical characteristics of the initial postures rather than species differences in CNS circuitry controlling stance; 2) hindlimb-dominated posture control is probably a common and relatively ancient pattern; and 3) reorganization of hominid CNS circuitry was probably unnecessary because hindlimb control was already a feature of the system."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the dynamical interaction among prey (bird), mesopredator (rat), and superpredator (cat) discussed in [Courchamp, F., Langlais, M., Sugihara, G., 1999. Cats protecting birds: modelling the mesopredator release effect. Journal of Animal Ecology 68, 282-292]. First, we develop a prey-mesopredator-superpredator (i.e., bird-rat-cat, briefly, BRC) model, where the predator's functional responses are derived based on the classical Holling's time budget arguments. Our BRC model overcomes several model construction problems in Courchamp et al. (1999), and admits richer, reasonable and realistic dynamics. We explore the possible control strategies to save or restore the bird by controlling or eliminating the rat or the cat when the bird is endangered. We establish the existence of two types of mesopredator release phenomena: severe mesopredator release, where once superpredators are suppressed, a burst of mesopredators follows which leads their shared prey to extinction; and mild mesopredator release, where the mesopredator release could assert more negative impact on the endemic prey but does not lead the endemic prey to extinction. A sharp sufficient criterion is established for the occurrence of severe mesopredator release. We also show that, in a prey-mesopredator-superpredator trophic food web, eradication of introduced superpredators such as feral domestic cats in the BRC model, is not always the best solution to protect endemic insular prey. The presence of a superpredator may have a beneficial effect in Such systems. (c) 2005 Society for Mathematical Biology. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The topographical organization of mossy fibre input to the forelimb area of the paravermal C3 zone in cerebellar lobules IV and V was investigated in barbiturate-anaesthetized cats and compared with the previously described microzonal organization of climbing fibre input to the same part of the cortex. Recordings were made in the Purkinje cell and granule cell layers from single climbing fibre and mossy fibre units, respectively, and the organization of cutaneous receptive fields was assessed for both types of afferents. 2. Based on spatial characteristics, receptive fields of single mossy fibres could be systematized into ten classes and a total of thirty-two subclasses, mainly in accordance with a scheme previously used for classification of climbing fibres. Different mossy fibres displayed a substantial range of sensitivity to natural peripheral stimulation, responded preferentially to phasic or tonic stimuli and were activated by brushing of hairs or light tapping of the skin. 3. Overall, mossy fibres to any given microzone had receptive fields resembling the climbing fibre receptive field defining that microzone. However, compared with the climbing fibre input, the mossy fibre input had a more intricate topographical organization. Mossy fibres with very similar receptive fields projected to circumscribed cortical regions, with a specific termination not only in the mediolateral, but also in some cases in the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral, dimensions of the zone. On the other hand, mossy fibre units with non-identical, albeit usually similar, receptive fields were frequently found in the same microelectrode track."

    "abstract": "Cats require more dietary protein than noncarnivorous species. Earlier work showed that cats lack the ability to regulate hepatic urea cycle enzymes in response to dietary protein concentration. We thus hypothesized that cats are unable to fully adapt protein oxidation to protein intake, particularly at low-protein concentrations. We used indirect respiration calorimetry to assess cats' ability to adapt substrate oxidation to diets containing different concentrations of protein, including 1 below their protein requirement. Nine cats (5 males and 4 females; 2.7 +/- 0.5 y; 4.49 +/- 0.19 kg) consumed each of 4 semipurified diets containing 7.5% [low protein (LP(3))], 14.2% [adequate protein (AP)], 27.1% [moderate protein (MP)], and 49.6% [high protein (HP)] of metabolizable energy from protein in a modified crossover design, beginning with the MP diet and then consuming the remaining diets in random order. After adaptation to each diet, cats completed a 5-d nitrogen balance trial and at least 2 12-h indirect calorimetry measurements. There was a significant effect of diet on protein oxidation (P < 0.0001), which measured 10.4 +/- 0.5, 14.1 +/- 1.0, 25.0 +/- 1.7, and 53.2 +/- 1.7% of total energy expenditure for the LP, AP, M,P and HP diets, respectively. The ratio of protein oxidation:protein intake was higher with the LP diet (1.39 +/- 0.07) than the other 3 diets (AP, 1.00 +/- 0.07; MP, 0.93 +/- 0.06; HP, 1.07 +/- 0.03; P < 0.0001), indicating a net loss of protein with the LP diet. Thus, cats are able to adapt protein oxidation to a wide range of dietary protein concentrations, provided their minimum protein requirement is met."

    "abstract": "It is well known that experimentally induced cochlear damage produces structural, physiological, and biochemical alterations in neurons of the cochlear nucleus. In contrast, much less is known with respect to the naturally occurring cochlear pathology presented by congenital deafness. The present study attempts to relate organ of Corti structure and auditory nerve activity to the morphology of primary synaptic endings in the cochlear nucleus of congenitally deaf white cats. Our observations reveal that the amount of sound-evoked spike activity in auditory nerve fibers influences terminal morphology and synaptic structure in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Some white cats had no hearing. They exhibited severely reduced spontaneous activity and no sound-evoked activity in auditory nerve fibers. They had no recognizable organ of Corti, presented >90% loss of spiral ganglion cells, and displayed marked structural abnormalities of endbulbs of Held and their synapses. Other white cats had partial hearing and possessed auditory nerve fibers with a wide range of spontaneous activity but elevated sound-evoked thresholds (60-70 dB SPL). They also exhibited obvious abnormalities in the tectorial membrane, supporting cells, and Reissner's membrane throughout the cochlear duct and had complete inner and outer hair cell loss in the base. The spatial distribution of spiral ganglion cell loss correlated with the pattern of hair cell loss. Primary neurons of hearing-impaired cats displayed structural abnormalities of their endbulbs and synapses in the cochlear nucleus which were intermediate in form compared to normal and totally deaf cats. Changes in endbulb structure appear to correspond to relative levels of deafness. These data suggest that endbulb structure is significantly influenced by sound-evoked auditory nerve activity."

Model outcomes indicated that cessation of population growth would require surgical sterilization for greater than 51% of adult and 51% of juvenile (<1 year) intact female cats annually, assuming an approximate 3-year mean life span. After the population stabilizes, this would equate to sterilizing approximately 14% of the total female population per year or having approximately 71% of the total female and 81% of the adult female population sterilized at all times. In the absence of juvenile sterilization, 91% of adult intact females would need to be sterilized annually to halt population growth. In comparison, with a 3-year nonsurgical contraception program, an annual contraception rate of 60% of female juvenile and adult intact cats would be required to halt population growth, assuming that treated cats were retrapped at the same rate after 3 years."

    "abstract": "The population of Sooty Terns Onychoprion fuscata breeding on Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean was monitored over 17 years (1990-2007). This period spanned the programme of feral Domestic Cat Felis silvestris catus eradication from the island, which commenced in 2001 with the last Cat recorded in 2004. We report on the abundance of Sooty Terns and Black Rats Rattus rattus before and after Cat eradication. The Sooty Tern breeding population in the 1990s averaged 368 000 and Cats were killing Terns at an average rate of 33 adults per night. Following Cat eradication, adult Terns are no longer predated. However, egg predation by both Rats and Common Mynas Acridotheres tristis has continued with Mynas destroying more eggs than Rats. Unexpectedly, we observed a change in Rat predatory behaviour. Following Cat eradication, Rats have become a major predator of Sooty Tern chicks. Despite this change, the Tern population has shown a season-on-season increase since Cat eradication, 48.8% in 2005, 8.2% in 2006 and 6.1% in 2007, and the breeding population increased to 420 000 birds in 2007. Incubation success improved from 66.0 to 84.4% during Cat eradication, before dropping down again to 67.9% after Cats were eradicated and Rat control measures were introduced. Index traplines were set for Rats and Rat numbers fluctuated widely immediately after Cats were eradicated but there were no significant differences that could be attributed to changes in Cat numbers. Ascension Island Sooty Terns breed every 9.6 months and juveniles defer breeding for seven seasons. Hence 2008 is the first year in which an increase in the breeding Sooty Tern population directly attributable to Cat eradication is likely to be detected. We conclude that long-term monitoring is essential to guide conservation practice even in this relatively simple predator-prey system."

    "abstract": "The domestic cat ( Felis catus ), a carnivore, naturally eats a very low carbohydrate diet. In contrast, the dog ( Canis familiaris ), a carno-omnivore, has a varied diet. This study was performed to determine the expression of the intestinal brush border membrane sodium/glucose cotransporter, SGLT1, sweet receptor, T1R2/T1R3, and disaccharidases in these species adapted to contrasting diets. The expression (this includes function) of SGLT1, sucrase, maltase and lactase were determined using purified brush border membrane vesicles and by quantitative immunohistochemistry of fixed tissues. The pattern of expression of subunits of the sweet receptor T1R2 and T1R3 was assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry. In proximal, middle, and distal small intestine, SGLT1 function in dogs was 1.9- to 2.3-fold higher than in cats ( P = 0.037, P = 0.0011, P = 0.027, respectively), and SGLT1 protein abundance followed an identical pattern. Both cats and dogs express T1R3 in a subset of intestinal epithelial cells, and dogs, but not cats, express T1R2. In proximal and middle regions, there were 3.1- and 1.6-fold higher lactase ( P = 0.006 and P = 0.019), 4.4- and 2.9-fold higher sucrase (both P < 0.0001), and 4.6- and 3.1-fold higher maltase activity ( P = 0.0026 and P = 0.0005), respectively, in the intestine of dogs compared with cats. Dogs have a potential higher capacity to digest and absorb carbohydrates than cats. Cats may suffer from carbohydrate malabsorption following ingestion of high-carbohydrate meals. However, dogs have a digestive ability to cope with diets containing significant levels of carbohydrate."

    "abstract": "Recently developed computational techniques have been used to reduce muscle activation patterns of high complexity to a simple synergy organization and to bring new insights to the long-standing degrees of freedom problem in motor control. We used a nonnegative factorization approach to identify muscle synergies during postural responses in the cat and to examine the functional significance of such synergies for natural behaviors. We hypothesized that the simplification of neural control afforded by muscle synergies must be matched by a similar reduction in degrees of freedom at the biomechanical level. Electromyographic data were recorded from 8-15 hindlimb muscles of cats exposed to 16 directions of support surface translation. Results showed that as few as four synergies could account for >95% of the automatic postural response across all muscles and all directions. Each synergy was activated for a specific set of perturbation directions, and moreover, each was correlated with a unique vector of endpoint force under the limb. We suggest that, within the context of active balance control, postural synergies reflect a neural command signal that specifies endpoint force of a limb."

We show here that a new unsupervised learning algorithm based on information maximization, a nonlinear \"infomax\" network, when applied to an ensemble of natural scenes produces sets of visual filters that are localized and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximization network. In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since this infomax network performs Independent Components Analysis or ICA, for sparse (super-gaussian) component distributions. We compare the resulting ICA filters and their associated basis functions, with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA). The ICA filters have more sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes. They also resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex, which suggests that these neurons form a natural, information-theoretic coordinate system for natural images."

    "abstract": "In the present work, dynamic clamp was used to inject a current that mimicked tonic synaptic activity in the soma of cat lumbar motoneurones with a microelectrode. The reversal potential of this current could be set at the resting potential so as to prevent membrane depolarization or hyperpolarization. The only effect of the dynamic clamp was then to elicit a constant and calibrated increase of the motoneurone input conductance. The effect of the resulting shunt was investigated on repetitive discharges elicited by current pulses. Shunting inhibition reduced very substantially the firing frequency in the primary range without changing the slope of the current-frequency curves. The shift of the I-f curve was proportional to the conductance increase imposed by the dynamic clamp and depended on an intrinsic property of the motoneurone that we called the shunt potential. The shunt potential ranged between 11 and 37 mV above the resting potential, indicating that the sensitivity of motoneurones to shunting inhibition was quite variable. The shunt potential was always near or above the action potential voltage threshold. A theoretical model allowed us to interpret these experimental results. The shunt potential was shown to be a weighted time average of membrane voltage. The weighting factor is the phase response function of the neurone that peaks at the end of the interspike interval. The shunt potential indicates whether mixed synaptic inputs have an excitatory or inhibitory effect on the ongoing discharge of the motoneurone."

    "abstract": "The development and structure of orientation (OR) and ocular dominance (OD) maps in the primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys can be modelled using the elastic net algorithm, which attempts to find an 'optimal' cortical representation of the input features. Here we analyse this behaviour in terms of parameters of the feature space. We derive expressions for the OR periodicity, and the first bifurcation point as a function of the annealing parameter using the methods of Durbin et al (Durbin R, Szeliski R and Yuille A 1989 Neural Computation 1 348-58). We also investigate the effect of the relative order of OR and OD development on overall map structure. This analysis suggests that developmental order can be predicted from the final OR and OD periodicities. In conjunction with experimentally measured values for these periodicities, the model predicts that (i) in normal macaques OD develops first, (ii) in normal cats OR develops first and (iii) in strabismic cats OD develops first."

    "abstract": "Objective—To determine the association among signalment, health status, other clinical variables, and treatments and events during cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) with the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for animals with cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) in a veterinary teaching hospital. Design—Cross-sectional study. Animals—161 dogs and 43 cats with CPA. Procedures—Data were gathered during a 60-month period on animals that had CPA and underwent CPCR. Logistic regression was used to evaluate effects of multiple predictors for ROSC. Results—56 (35%) dogs and 19 (44%) cats had successful CPCR. Twelve (6%) animals (9 dogs and 3 cats) were discharged from the hospital. Successfully resuscitated dogs were significantly more likely to have been treated with mannitol, lidocaine, fluids, dopamine, corticosteroids, or vasopressin; had CPA while anesthetized; received chest compressions while positioned in lateral recumbency; and had a suspected cause of CPA other than hemorrhage or anemia, shock, hypoxemia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cerebral trauma, malignant arrhythmia, or an anaphylactoid reaction and were less likely to have been treated with multiple doses of epinephrine, had a longer duration of CPA, or had multiple disease conditions, compared with findings in dogs that were not successfully resuscitated. Successfully resuscitated cats were significantly more likely to have had more people participate in CPCR and less likely to have had shock as the suspected cause of CPA, compared with findings in cats that were not successfully resuscitated. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—The prognosis was grave for animals with CPA, except for those that had CPA while anesthetized. ("

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The endocrine diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism in cats currently is based on an increased plasma aldosterone to renin ratio, which has several disadvantages for use in veterinary practice. OBJECTIVES: To establish a reference range for the urinary aldosterone to creatinine ratio (UACR) and to determine whether oral administration of either sodium chloride or fludrocortisone acetate is effective for use in a suppression test. ANIMALS: Forty-two healthy cats from an animal shelter and 1 cat with primary hyperaldosteronism from a veterinary teaching hospital. METHODS: Morning urine samples for determination of the basal UACR were collected from 42 healthy cats. For the suppression tests, urine samples for the UACR were collected after twice daily oral administration for 4 consecutive days of either sodium chloride, 0.25 g/kg body weight (n = 22) or fludrocortisone acetate, 0.05 mg/kg body weight (n = 15). RESULTS: The median basal UACR was 7.2 x 10(-9) (range, 1.8-52.3 x 10(-9)), with a calculated reference range of < 46.5 x 10(-9). Administration of sodium chloride resulted in adequate salt loading in 10 of 22 cats, but without significant reduction in the UACR. Administration of fludrocortisone resulted in a significant decrease in the UACR (median, 78%; range, 44-97%; P < .001) in healthy cats. In the cat with an aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma, the basal UACR and the UACR after fludrocortisone administration were 32 x 10(-9) and 36 x 10(-9), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Using the UACR for an oral fludrocortisone suppression test may be useful for the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism in cats."

    "abstract": "The organization of primary visual cortex (V1) into functional maps makes individual cells operate in a variety of contexts. For instance, some neurons lie in regions of fairly homogeneous orientation preference (iso-orientation domains), while others lie in regions with a variety of preferences (e.g., pinwheel centers). We asked whether this diversity in local map structure correlates with the degree of selectivity of spike responses. We used a combination of imaging and electrophysiology to reveal that neurons in regions of homogeneous orientation preference have much sharper tuning. Moreover, in both monkeys and cats, a common principle links the structure of the orientation map, on the spatial scale of dendritic integration, to the degree of selectivity of individual cells. We conclude that neural computation is not invariant across the cortical surface. This finding must factor into future theories of receptive field wiring and map development."

By adhering to this Code, people involved in animal breeding demonstrate to the general community their concern for the welfare of the animals in their care. When humans manipulate or limit an animal’s choices in relation to its physical or social environment, the welfare of that animal must be considered. Humans have a duty of care towards these animals and the greater the level of intervention or control of an animal or its environment, the greater those responsibilities become. Animal welfare can be thought of as the way an animal’s health, safety and well- being are affected by its physical and social environment. Health and behaviour indicators provide information about how an animal is responding to a situation, thus enabling us to make informed decisions relating to the animal’s welfare."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare the potential of autotransfusion devices to reduce non-infectious complications related to transfusion of long-stored packed red blood cells (PRBC; n= 57), such as changes in electrolytes, blood cells and the load of free microaggregates. Following a baseline measurement, a blood pool of three PRBC was divided into three equal volumes and washed with either the Haemonetics Cell Saver (HCS) or the continuous autotransfusion system (C.A.T.S), using the quality (CATS(quality)) and emergency (CATS(emergency)) mode. After the washing procedure, measurements for electrolytes, blood cells and free microaggregates were repeated (n= 19 each). Compared with baseline, the investigated autotransfusion devices reduced the median load of potassium (baseline: 52 mEq L(-1); HCS: 4 mEq L(-1); CATS(quality): 4 mEq L(-1); CATS(emergency): 17 mEq L(-1); each P < 0.001), restored a physiologic electrolyte balance and significantly decreased the load of leucocytes, glucose and protein. Whereas the quantity of microaggregates was not reduced by HCS, CATS(emergency) decreased the load of cell fragments below 7.8 microm (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Using CATS(quality) decreased the load of cell fragments not only to a diameter below 7.8 microm (P < 0.001 vs. baseline) but also of microaggregates between 7.8 and 17.6 microm (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). In situations where long-stored PRBC have to be transfused, the procedure described here may be feasible to reduce clinically relevant side effects, i.e. hyperkalaemia and microvascular obstruction secondary to free cell fragments. This approach could be especially useful in patients undergoing massive transfusion and/or suffering from renal failure."

We exploited this phenomenon of interocular suppression to investigate the neuronal correlate of binocular rivalry in primary visual cortex of awake strabismic cats. Monocularly presented stimuli that were readily perceived by the animal evoked synchronized discharges with an oscillatory patterning in the gamma-frequency range. Upon dichoptic stimulation, neurons responding to the stimulus that continued to be perceived increased the synchronicity and the regularity of their oscillatory patterning while the reverse was true for neurons responding to the stimulus that was no longer perceived. These differential changes were not associated with modifications of discharge rate, suggesting that at early stages of visual processing the degree of synchronicity rather than the amplitude of responses determines which signals are perceived and control behavioral responses."

Virus-specific nucleic acids were detected in pharyngeal swabs from 3 of 40 randomly sampled cats from a group of 194 animals (day 8 after contact with an infected swan). All cats were transferred to a quarantine station and monitored for clinical signs, virus shedding, and antibody production until day 50. Despite unfamiliar handling, social distress, and the presence of other viral and nonviral pathogens that caused illness and poor health and compromised the immune systems, clinical signs of influenza did not develop in any of the cats. There was no evidence of horizontal transmission to other cats because antibodies against H5N1 virus developed in only 2 cats."

A total of 86 dogs and 38 cats was repeatedly examined for T. cruzi infection by serology and/or xenodiagnosis. The composite prevalence of infection in dogs (60%), but not in cats, increased significantly with age and with the domiciliary density of infected T. infestans. Dogs and cats had similarly high forces of infection, prevalence of infectious hosts (41-42%), and infectiousness to bugs at a wide range of infected bug densities. The infectiousness to bugs of seropositive dogs declined significantly with increasing dog age and was highly aggregated. Individual dog infectiousness to bugs was significantly autocorrelated over time. Domestic T. infestans fed on dogs showed higher infection prevalence (49%) than those fed on cats (39%), humans (38%) or chickens (29%) among 1085 bugs examined. The basic reproduction number of T. cruzi in dogs was at least 8.2. Both cats and dogs are epidemiologically important sources of infection for bugs and householders, dogs nearly 3 times more than cats."

The normal anatomy and function of the pancreas and a review of the current state of knowledge about the pathophysiology of pancreatitis is discussed. The current prevalence of feline pancreatitis is unknown, but the disease is being reported with increasing frequency. The aetiology of pancreatitis and the types of pancreatic inflammation present in cats is different from other species, such as the dog, a species where the disease is considered more common. Concurrent diseases are often present that may be more serious than the pancreatic inflammation and the treatment of these diseases is often complicated by pancreatitis."

    "abstract": "This paper describes a genetic analysis of wild-living cats in Scotland. Samples from 230 wild-living Scottish cats (including 13 museum skins) and 74 house cats from England and Scotland were surveyed for nine microsatellite loci. Pelage characteristics of the wild-living cats were recorded, and the cats were then grouped into five separate categories depending on the degree to which they conformed to the characteristics attributed to Felis silvestris Schreber, 1775. Allele frequency differences between the morphological groups are greater than those among the three house cat samples. Analysis of genetic distances suggests that more of the differences between individuals can be explained by pelage than geographical proximity, and that pelage and geographical location are not confounded. Ordination of the genetic distances suggests two main groups of wild-living cats, with intermediates, and one group is genetically very similar to the house cats, while the other group contains all cats taxonomically identified as wildcat based on morphology. A genetic mixture analysis gives similar results to the ordination, but also suggests that the genotypes of a substantial number of cats in the wildcat group are drawn from a gene pool with genotypes in approximately equilibrium proportions. We argue that this is evidence that these cats do not have very recent domestic ancestry. However, from the morphological data it is highly likely that this gene pool also contains a contribution from earlier introgression of domestic cat genes."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perceptual learning has been documented in adult humans over a wide range of tasks. Although the often-observed specificity of learning is generally interpreted as evidence for training-induced plasticity in early cortical areas, physiological evidence for training-induced changes in early visual cortical areas is modest, despite reports of learning-induced changes of cortical activities in fMRI studies. To reveal the physiological bases of perceptual learning, we combined psychophysical measurements with extracellular single-unit recording under anesthetized preparations and examined the effects of training in grating orientation identification on both perceptual and neuronal contrast sensitivity functions of cats. RESULTS: We have found that training significantly improved perceptual contrast sensitivity of the cats to gratings with spatial frequencies near the \"trained\" spatial frequency, with stronger effects in the trained eye. Consistent with behavioral assessments, the mean contrast sensitivity of neurons recorded from V1 of the trained cats was significantly higher than that of neurons recorded from the untrained cats. Furthermore, in the trained cats, the contrast sensitivity of V1 neurons responding preferentially to stimuli presented via the trained eyes was significantly greater than that of neurons responding preferentially to stimuli presented via the \"untrained\" eyes. The effect was confined to the trained spatial frequencies. In both trained and untrained cats, the neuronal contrast sensitivity functions derived from the contrast sensitivity of the individual neurons were highly correlated with behaviorally determined perceptual contrast sensitivity functions. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that training-induced neuronal contrast gain in area V1 underlies behaviorally determined perceptual contrast sensitivity improvements."

    "abstract": "Since 1999, Cryptococcus gattii has emerged as an important pathogen of humans and animals in British Columbia, Canada. Nasal swabs and serum samples were collected from dogs and cats residing within the Coastal Douglas Fir biogeoclimatic zone on Vancouver Island, where clinical cases have been reported. Deep and superficial nasal fungal cultures of 280 dogs and 94 cats identified four (4.3%) cats and three (1.1%) dogs with C. gattii serotype B in their nasal cavity. Serum samples collected from 266 dogs and 84 cats identified six (7.1%) cats and two (0.8%) dogs with a positive cryptococcal antigen titer. Overall cats were 4.4 times more likely than dogs to be positive on one or both tests. Identification of sub-clinical infection and nasal colonization is an important step in the characterization of the outbreak of clinical cryptococcosis on Vancouver Island."

It is superior to radiography which failed to allow identification of the abnormality in two of our five cats. MR imaging for middle ear disease should include dorsal and transverse plane images using T1- and T2-weighted sequences. In the presence of a mass within the bulla or the external ear canal application of contrast medium is helpful."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tubulointerstitial kidney disease is a common cause of illness and death in pet cats and is typically not associated with overt proteinuria. HYPOTHESIS: Proteinuria would be independently related to survival in cats with renal failure, with or without hypertension. ANIMALS: The study included 136 client-owned cats; 28 apparently normal, 14 hypertensive but not azotemic, 66 azotemic but not hypertensive, and 28 both hypertensive and azotemic. METHODS: Cox's proportional hazards model was used to determine the influence of initial plasma creatinine concentration, proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio), age, and systemic hypertension on the risk of death or euthanasia during the follow-up period. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the relation between severity of proteinuria and predictive variables, including age, plasma creatinine concentration, systolic blood pressure, sex, and urine specific gravity. RESULTS: Plasma creatinine concentration and proteinuria were very highly related to survival. The hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for death or euthanasia was 2.9 (1.4-6.3) and 4.0 (2.0-8.0) for urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 0.2-0.4 and >0.4, respectively, compared with the baseline group with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of <0.2 and were 2.4 (1.2-4.8) and 4.9 (2.3-10.2) for an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30-82 mg/g and <82 mg/g, respectively, compared with a baseline group with albumin-to-creatinine ratio of <30 mg/g. Treated hypertensive cats did not have reduced survival, although systolic blood pressure, together with plasma creatinine concentration was positively related to the magnitude of proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Despite the relatively low concentrations of proteinuria typical of chronic renal disease in cats, this measurement is of prognostic significance"

However, it may not be as uncommon as previously thought due to the increased awareness of the disease and the increasing availability of endoscopy. Esophagitis can be caused by gastroesophageal reflux, trauma, foreign bodies, ingestion of caustic substances, structural abnormalities (ie, hiatal hernia, neoplasms), and chronic vomiting. This article will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of esophagitis secondary to gastroesophageal reflux. This is a diagnosis based on clinical signs, exclusion of other causes of esophagitis, and typical radiographic, endoscopic, and histopathologic findings."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) is one of the world's least known, highly threatened felids with a distribution restricted to tropical lowland rainforests in Peninsular Thailand/Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. Throughout its geographic range large-scale anthropogenic transformation processes, including the pollution of fresh-water river systems and landscape fragmentation, raise concerns regarding its conservation status. Despite an increasing number of camera-trapping field surveys for carnivores in South-East Asia during the past two decades, few of these studies recorded the flat-headed cat. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we designed a predictive species distribution model using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to reassess the potential current distribution and conservation status of the flat-headed cat. Eighty-eight independent species occurrence records were gathered from field surveys, literature records, and museum collections. These current and historical records were analysed in relation to bioclimatic variables (WorldClim), altitude (SRTM) and minimum distance to larger water resources (Digital Chart of the World). Distance to water was identified as the key predictor for the occurrence of flat-headed cats (>50% explanation). In addition, we used different land cover maps (GLC2000, GlobCover and SarVision LLC for Borneo), information on protected areas and regional human population density data to extract suitable habitats from the potential distribution predicted by the MaxEnt model. Between 54% and 68% of suitable habitat has already been converted to unsuitable land cover types (e.g. croplands, plantations), and only between 10% and 20% of suitable land cover is categorised as fully protected according to the IUCN criteria. The remaining habitats are highly fragmented and only a few larger forest patches remain. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on our findings, we recommend that future conservation efforts for the flat-headed cat should focus on the identified remaining key localities and be implemented through a continuous dialogue between local stakeholders, conservationists and scientists to ensure its long-term survival. The flat-headed cat can serve as a flagship species for the protection of several other endangered species associated with the threatened tropical lowland forests and surface fresh-water sources in this region."

    "abstract": "Despite aggressive pre- or postoperative treatment, feline fibrosarcomas have a high relapse rate. In this study, a new treatment option based on immune stimulation by intra-tumoral delivery of three feline cytokine genes was performed. The objective of this phase-I dose-escalation study was to determine a safe dose for further evaluation in a subsequent phase-II trial. Twenty-five client-owned cats with clinical diagnosis of fibrosarcoma - primary tumours as well as recurrences - entered the study. Four increasing doses of plasmids coding for feIL-2, feIFN-gamma or feGM-CSF, respectively, were previously defined. In groups I, II, III and IV these doses were 15, 50, 150 and 450 microg per plasmid and a corresponding amount of magnetic nanoparticles. Two preoperative intra-tumoral injections of the magnetic DNA solution were followed by magnetofection. A group of four control cats received only surgical treatment. Side effects were registered and graded according to the VCOG-CTCAE scale and correlated to treatment. Statistical analyses included one-way anova, post hoc and Kruskal-Wallis tests. ELISA tests detecting plasma feIFN-gamma and plasma feGM-CSF were performed. One cat out of group IV (450 microg per plasmid) showed adverse events probably related to gene delivery. As these side effects were self-limiting and occurred only in one of eight cats in group IV, this dose was determined to be well tolerable. Altogether six cats developed local recurrences during a 1-year observation period. Four of these cats had been treated with dose IV. Regarding these observations, a subsequent phase-II trial including a representative amount of cats should be tested for the efficacy of dose IV as well as dose III."

    "abstract": "While subsidised populations of feral cats are known to impact their prey populations, little is known about the ecological impact of inside/outside hunting cats (IOHC). We studied IOHC around a suburban nature preserve. Mail surveys indicated an average of 0.275 IOHC/house, leading to a regional density estimate of 0.32 IOHC/ha. A geographical model of cat density was created based on local house density and distance from forest/neighbourhood edge. IOHC hunted mostly small mammals, averaging 1.67 prey brought home/cat/month and a kill rate of 13%. Predation rates based on kills brought home was lower than the estimate from observing hunting cats (5.54 kills/cat/month). IOHC spent most outside time in their or their immediate neighbours' garden/yard, or in the nearby forest edge; 80% of observed hunts occurred in a garden/yard or in the first 10 in of forest. Radio-tracked IOHC averaged 0.24 ha in home-range size (95% minimum convex polygon (MCP)) and rarely entered forest. Confirming this, scent stations detected cats more often near the edge and more cats were detected in smaller forest fragments. There was no relationship between the number of cats detected in an area and the local small mammal abundance or rodent seed predation rates. Cold weather and healthy cat predator populations are speculated to minimise the ecological impact of IOHC on this area."

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cell (r.g.c.) axons (n = 17) in the optic tract of 4‐5 week‐old kittens and adult cats (n = 4, this study, n = 27 from other reports) were studied both physiologically and morphologically. Axons were initially classified during extracellular recording with a battery of physiological tests that included Fourier analysis of the response to a sinusoidally counterphased sine‐wave grating. Y axons had a significant second harmonic response component (greater than twice the fundamental) present independent of the spatial phase position of the grating. These axons were then recorded from intracellularly and subsequently filled ionophoretically with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The HRP filled the axons' terminal arborizations in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.). The innervation pattern and and structure of the terminal arborizations of the kitten r.g.c. Y axons were compared to those of the adult. The kitten Y axons innervated the l.g.n. in a pattern similar to that of the adult (individual branches from a single axon always innervated lamina A or A1 and may also have innervated lamina C, the medial interlaminar nucleus (m.i.n.) and/or sent branches that coursed medial to the l.g.n.). Fourteen of seventeen of these Y axons in the kitten innervated either of the A‐laminae heavily (greater than 200 terminal boutons per axon). The remaining three r.g.c. Y axons in the kitten had only small arborizations within lamina A (less than fifty terminal boutons per axon) but heavily innervated lamina C. The structure of the terminal boutons on the kitten r.g.c. Y axons was highly variable when compared to axons of adult cats. Some of the boutons were spherical or crenulated as in the adult. Many others had filopodia and growth cone‐like terminals with fine extensions. This variable maturation of terminal boutons was seen both between axons and on individual axons. The number of boutons on the kitten r.g.c. Y axons in the A‐laminae was significantly less than that of adult Y axons. The mean numbers of boutons per axon were 476 and 1553 in the kittens and adult cats, respectively (P less than 0.001, Mann‐Whitney U test). The width of the terminal arborization of individual Y axons in the A‐laminae of the kittens was considerably smaller than in adult cats (mean widths of the terminal arborizations are 192 and 293 micron in the kittens and adult cats, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1985 The Physiological Society"

Antibodies to all pathogens were detected in all survey areas. Overall prevalence rates were 0.075 for Yersinia pestis, 0.089 for Francisella tularensis, 0.025 for Rickettsia rickettsii (dogs only), and 0.029, 0.178 and 0.186 for SNV, B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae, respectively (cats only). This serological survey of rural dogs and cats was more sensitive and efficient than previous surveys based on collection and culture of rodents and ectoparasites. All six pathogens appear endemic to the region. Surveillance for plague, tularemia, RMSF and SNV, and management of associated public risks should be done in endemic regions."

Many studies have examined the effect of a stimulus on the mean response, but few have examined the effect on response variability. We measured neural variability in 13 extracellularly recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset from seven areas spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input."

    "abstract": "Neuronal responses to visual stimuli that are correlated on a millisecond time scale are well documented in several areas of the mammalian visual cortex. This coherent activity often takes the form of synchronous rhythmic discharges ranging in frequency from 20 to 70 Hz. We performed experiments to determine the incidence and properties of this rhythmic activity in the striate cortex of alert cats and to compare this activity to similar data collected in the striate cortex of anesthetized cats. The results demonstrate that optimal visual stimuli evoke robust, locally synchronous, 20-70 Hz oscillatory responses in the striate cortex of cats that are fully alert and performing a visual fixation task. The oscillatory activity is stimulus dependent, largely absent during periods of spontaneous activity, and shows a systematic increase in frequency with increasing stimulus velocity. Thus, the synchronous oscillatory activity observed in this and earlier studies cannot be explained as an artifact of anesthesia nor as a phenomenon that occurs independent of visual stimulation. Rather, it is a robust process that is present in the alert state and is dependent on the presence and specific properties of visual stimuli."

    "abstract": "Commercial dry and canned diets fed to cats cause approximately two- and fourfold increase in the taurine requirement, respectively, as compared with that observed for purified diets. In two experiments, the effect of source and level of protein and fiber in the diet on the concentration of taurine in plasma and whole blood of cats was studied. All diets contained 1 g taurine/kg dry matter. When a casein-based diet containing either 25% or 50% protein was given to cats for 6 wk, no difference in plasma taurine concentration was observed; however, substituting soybean protein for casein resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in plasma taurine concentration of cats in the 50% soybean protein group, but not in the 25% soybean protein group. In Experiment 2, the food intake of cats was limited [26 g dry matter/(kg body weight.d)], and the protein was 30 or 60% of the diet. Cats fed 60% soybean protein or casein diets had significantly lower plasma taurine concentrations than cats fed a 30% casein diet, with the 60% soybean protein diet causing the greater decrease. There was no effect of either 2 or 4% soybean fiber on plasma taurine concentration as compared with the same diet without the added fiber. The taurine concentration in plasma was higher (P < 0.05) in male cats than in female cats. Protein source, amount in the diet and gender did not affect the whole blood taurine concentration. Cats given diets containing 60% casein or soybean protein diets excreted a greater amount of fecal total bile acid and total taurine than cats given a 30% casein diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

    "abstract": "Responses to noise were recorded in ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) neurons of anesthetized chinchillas and cats, then analyzed using Wiener-kernel theory. First-order kernels, which are proportional to reverse-correlation functions, of primary-like (PL) and primary-like with notch (PLN) neurons having low characteristic frequency (CF) are similar to those obtained in auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Such kernels consist of lightly damped transient oscillations with frequency equal to the neuron's CF. The first-order kernel of high-CF PL and PLN neurons displays no evidence of tuning to CF. Second-order kernels of the aforementioned VCN neuron types also resemble those in the nerve, irrespective of CF. In general, first- and second-order Wiener kernels of chopper neurons are similar to those obtained in high-CF ANFs. This is likely the consequence of the poor phase-locking capabilities to near-CF tones exhibited by chopper neurons. By analyzing second-order kernels using singular-value decomposition, it was possible to estimate group delays for the entire neuronal population, regardless of the neuron's type or CF. This was done by analyzing the highest-ranking singular vector (FSV). Amplitude values of FSVs in chopper neurons in the cat are substantially larger than in high-spontaneous ANFs."

    "abstract": "The effect of ischaemic neuromyopathy in cats on peripheral muscles and nerves is described. Motor function was severely decreased distal to the stifle particularly in the cranial tibial muscles. Skin sensation was absent distal to the mid tibial or hock level. The affected muscles were often hard and painful. Improvement of motor function began two to three weeks after onset and complete recovery could occur. Conduction to the interosseous and anterior tibial muscles is absent or severely reduced initially but returned and improved within two weeks. A few peripheral nerve fibres could survive the ischaemia, others showed varying defects on the myelin sheath but the majority degenerated. Shorter term recoveries were probably due to repair of the myelin sheath. Regenerated nerve fibres were also demonstrated. The cranial tibial muscles were commonly infarcted while less severe myopathic changes were found in the gastrocnemii. Provided further ischaemic episodes can be prevented the prognosis in these cases appears good."

    "abstract": "Dogs' (Canis familiaris) and cats' (Felis catus) interspecific communicative behavior toward humans was investigated. In Experiment 1, the ability of dogs and cats to use human pointing gestures in an object-choice task was compared using 4 types of pointing cues differing in distance between the signaled object and the end of the fingertip and in visibility duration of the given signal. Using these gestures, both dogs and cats were able to find the hidden food; there was no significant difference in their performance. In Experiment 2, the hidden food was made inaccessible to the subjects to determine whether they could indicate the place of the hidden food to a naive owner. Cats lacked some components of attention-getting behavior compared with dogs. The results suggest that individual familiarization with pointing gestures ensures high-level performance in the presence of such gestures; however, species-specific differences could cause differences in signaling toward the human."

    "abstract": "When the brain is deprived of input from one sensory modality, it often compensates with supranormal performance in one or more of the intact sensory systems. In the absence of acoustic input, it has been proposed that cross-modal reorganization of deaf auditory cortex may provide the neural substrate mediating compensatory visual function. We tested this hypothesis using a battery of visual psychophysical tasks and found that congenitally deaf cats, compared with hearing cats, have superior localization in the peripheral field and lower visual movement detection thresholds. In the deaf cats, reversible deactivation of posterior auditory cortex selectively eliminated superior visual localization abilities, whereas deactivation of the dorsal auditory cortex eliminated superior visual motion detection. Our results indicate that enhanced visual performance in the deaf is caused by cross-modal reorganization of deaf auditory cortex and it is possible to localize individual visual functions in discrete portions of reorganized auditory cortex."

    "abstract": "1. Introduced rabbits are known to have catastrophic effects on oceanic islands, either by direct destruction of the vegetative cover, or by the resulting disturbance of indigenous vertebrates. 2. Another dramatic effect, less well known, but potentially of major importance, is the hyperpredation process. This process, related to apparent competition, predicts that an introduced prey species, well adapted to high predation pressure, could induce the extinction of an indigenous prey, through the sudden increased population size of an introduced predator. In many island ecosystems, the simultaneous presence of introduced feral cats and rabbits is thus potentially a further threat for small vertebrates endemic of these islands. 3. Through a mathematical model, we tested this hypothesis, using a tri-trophic system comprising an indigenous prey (birds), an introduced prey (rabbits) and an introduced predator (cats), and we demonstrated the theoretical existence of the hyperpredation process. 4. In addition, the numerical analysis of the model allowed a quantification of this process. It shows that the conditions required for an indigenous species to cope with the hyperpredation process imply very high intrinsic growth rates and/or carrying capacity, as well as behavioural anti-predator response to the introduced predator. Since these conditions are unlikely to be met, this process is a further potential threat to most indigenous vertebrate prey. 5. Finally, our model shows that, although it can be induced by both types of adaptation together or alone, behavioural adaptations alone are more powerful in generating the hyperpredation process, than are life history traits adaptations."

Stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is the most common clinical manifestation of cerebrovascular disease, and can be broadly divided into ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke results from occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel by a thrombus or embolism, depriving the brain of oxygen and glucose, whereas hemorrhagic stroke results from rupture of a blood vessel wall within the brain parenchyma or subarachnoid space. Previously considered uncommon, CVA is being recognized with greater frequency in veterinary medicine since magnetic resonance imaging has become more readily available. Once the diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke is confirmed, potential underlying causes should be sought after and treated accordingly."

The diverse histopathologic changes are unique to this aberrant migration and consist of a combination of five characteristic features: 1) parasitic track lesion (7/10), 2) superficial laminar cerebrocortical necrosis (10/10), 3) cerebral infarction (8/10), 4) subependymal rarefaction and astrogliosis with or without ependymal cell loss (7/10), and 5) subpial astrogliosis (7/10). Changes 2-5 occurred throughout the parenchyma unassociated with the track lesion or the parasite in the affected tissue. The larvae have been recovered most commonly in the region of the olfactory bulbs and peduncles, optic nerves, and cribriform plate, suggesting entry from the nasal cavity. Many of the changes noted are suggestive of a toxic factor elaborated by the parasite and borne within the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as vascular compromise as a component in those cats with brain infarction. Because of the prevalence of infarction associated with this syndrome and the lack of reported cases of such lesions in regions of the world devoid of the fly, we propose that aberrant cuterebral larval migration in the brain is the cause of feline ischemic encephalopathy."

    "abstract": "The diversity of the feline intestinal microbiota has not been well elucidated. The aim of this study was to characterize fecal microbiota of cats by comparative sequence analysis with universal bacterial 16S rRNA gene and group-specific primers for Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. Using universal bacterial primers, a total of 133 non-redundant 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified in fecal samples obtained from 15 healthy pet cats. The majority of these sequences were assigned to the phylum Firmicutes, followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Further classification showed that Firmicutes were predominantly affiliated with Clostridium clusters XI, XIVa, and I. Using group-specific primers for Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp., 364 clones were analyzed in fecal samples obtained from 12 additional cats and these bacterial genera were observed in 100% and 92% of cats, respectively. These detection rates differed from those obtained using universal bacterial primers, where Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. were each detected in 2 cats (13.3%). Overall, 23 different Lactobacillus-like and 11 Bifidobacterium-like sequences were identified. We observed marked differences in the prevalence of the various lactic acid bacteria in individual cats. In conclusion, the use of a combination of universal and group-specific primers allows a more detailed characterization of lactic acid bacteria in the feline intestine. While Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. are prevalent in feline fecal samples, individual animals show a unique species distribution."

    "abstract": "A study was conducted to evaluate the clinical response of diabetic cats to a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. Adult cats with diabetes mellitus of at least 4 months' duration were recruited and fed a high-fiber, moderate-fat canned diet for 1 to 2 months during the standardization period. All cats were then transitioned to a high-protein, low-carbohydrate canned diet for a 3-month treatment period. Analyses of treatment effect included hematology, serum biochemistry, fructosamine, lipid profile, and postprandial glucose curves. Cats were also monitored for changes in body weight, appetite, activity level, urinary habits, and insulin requirements. Nine cats completed the study protocol. All cats remained generally stable throughout the treatment period, although there was a slight overall improvement in activity. Insulin levels were decreased in eight of the nine cats when transitioned from the high-fiber diet to the high-protein diet, and insulin injections were completely stopped in three of the cats. Results of regression analysis indicated that exogenous insulin could be reduced by over 50% with no loss in glucose control, as measured by serum fructosamine. Results of this study support the use of a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet in the management of cats with diabetes mellitus."

This gastric radiolucent band was seen in 13 of 37 (35%) radiographs. There was no relationship between age, weight and relative obesity and the presence of this radiolucent band. Using CT, an intramural hypoattenuating layer was detected in the stomach wall of four of 15 (27%) cats. The intramural radiolucent band was visible on the radiographs in all four of those cats. This radiographic and CT finding was histologically determined to be normal fat in the gastric submucosa in one cat cadaver."

Modern One Health tends to focus on zoonotic pathogens emerging from wildlife and production animal species, but one of the most significant One Health challenges is rabies for which there is a canine reservoir. This review considers the role of small companion animals in One Health and specifically addresses the major vector-borne infectious diseases that are shared by man, dogs and cats. The most significant of these are leishmaniosis, borreliosis, bartonellosis, ehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis and anaplasmosis. The challenges that lie ahead in this field of One Health are discussed, together with the role of the newly formed World Small Animal Veterinary Association One Health Committee."

The virus is a novel coronavirus, which may have an origin in wild animals such as civet cats in southern China. Its genome structure, gene expression pattern and protein profiles are similar to those of other coronaviruses. However, distinct patterns of several open reading frames in the SARS virus genome may contribute to its severe virulence. The potential mutability of the coronavirus genome may pose problems in the control of future SARS outbreaks. The mechanism of SARS pathogenesis may involve both direct viral cytocidal effects on the target cells and immune-mediated mechanisms. The life cycle of the SARS virus is largely unknown; however, based on the analogy with other coronaviruses, several potential targets for antiviral development are identified. Vaccines offer an important preventive measure for possible future recurrences of SARS, but the prospect for their development is still unknown because of the uncertainty regarding the role of immune responses in SARS virus pathogenesis. The comparative studies of other coronaviruses offer insights into the understanding of SARS virus"

    "abstract": "For almost a decade now, a team of molecular evolutionists has produced a plethora of seemingly precise molecular clock estimates for divergence events ranging from the speciation of cats and dogs to lineage separations that might have occurred approximately 4 billion years ago. Because the appearance of accuracy has an irresistible allure, non-specialists frequently treat these estimates as factual. In this article, we show that all of these divergence-time estimates were generated through improper methodology on the basis of a single calibration point that has been unjustly denuded of error. The illusion of precision was achieved mainly through the conversion of statistical estimates (which by definition possess standard errors, ranges and confidence intervals) into errorless numbers. By employing such techniques successively, the time estimates of even the most ancient divergence events were made to look deceptively precise. For example, on the basis of just 15 genes, the arthropod-nematode divergence event was 'calculated' to have occurred 1167+/-83 million years ago (i.e. within a 95% confidence interval of approximately 350 million years). Were calibration and derivation uncertainties taken into proper consideration, the 95% confidence interval would have turned out to be at least 40 times larger ( approximately 14.2 billion years)."

    "abstract": "This prospective observational study evaluated client-reported recurrence of lower urinary tract signs (LUTS) and other signs of abnormalities in cats with idiopathic cystitis after institution of multimodal environmental modification (MEMO). Forty-six client-owned indoor-housed cats with idiopathic cystitis, diagnosed based on a history of recurrent LUTS and evidence of absence of urolithiasis or bacterial urinary tract infection were studied. In addition to their usual care, clients were offered recommendations for MEMO based on a detailed environmental history. Cases were followed for 10 months by client contact to determine the effect of MEMO on LUTS and other signs. Significant (P < 0.05) reductions in LUTS, fearfulness, nervousness, signs referable to the respiratory tract, and a trend (P < 0.1) toward reduced aggressive behavior and signs referable to the lower intestinal tract were identified. These results suggest that MEMO is a promising adjunctive therapy for indoor-housed cats with LUTS, and should be followed up with prospective controlled clinical trials."

Clinical signs of vestibular disease include asymmetric ataxia, head tilt, and pathologic nystagmus. Neuroanatomic localization of observed vestibular signs to either the peripheral or central components of the vestibular system is paramount to the management of the patient with vestibular dysfunction, as the etiology, diagnostic approaches, and prognoses are dependent on the neuroanatomic diagnosis. This article reviews functional vestibular neuroanatomy as well as the diagnosis and treatment of common causes of small animal vestibular disease."

    "abstract": "Oral contamination with Toxoplasma gondii oocysts shed by cats into the environment has been linked to severe outbreaks of human toxoplasmosis. Pigeons (Columba livia) are highly susceptible to oral infection with oocysts and indirectly indicate soil contamination, since they feed from the ground. A seroprevalence study was performed on cats and pigeons captured in the city of Lisbon. Serum samples collected from 1507 pigeons captured at 64 feeding sites and 423 stray cats were screened for antibodies anti- T. gondii using a commercial direct agglutination test. Seroprevalence in pigeons was 2.6% (39/1507) (95% CI: 1.9-3.5%) and 37.5% (24/64) of pigeon flocks sampled showed to be infected with T. gondii. The proportion of infected pigeons within seropositive flocks ranged between 4.8% and 21.1%. Among cats, seroprevalence was 44.2% (187/423) (95% CI: 39.5-49.1%). Isolation of T. gondii from animal tissues was attempted by in vitro assay. Inoculation of brain homogenates from 20 pigeons and 56 cats into Vero cell cultures allowed isolation of T. gondii from 13 pigeons (65%) and 15 cats (26.8%). Inoculation of muscle homogenates (heart and limbs) prepared by acid-peptic digestion from a subset of 15 cats resulted in the recovery of T. gondii from 10 cats (66.7%). © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

    "abstract": "This paper reviews recent studies on the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii. Tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites are the three infectious stages of T. gondii. Humans and animals become infected mainly by ingesting bradyzoites or oocytes. After ingestion, both bradyzoites and sporozoites convert to tachyzoites inside tissues. The conversion of tachyzoites to bradyzoites and bradyzoites to tachyzoites is of biological and clinical significance because bradyzoites are less susceptible to chemotherapy and reactivation of bradyzoites to tachyzoites is considered the cause of fatal toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients. Of all the methods currently available to assess stage conversion of T. gondii, feeding infective stages to cats is the most reliable method. Felidae, the definitive hosts of T. gondii excrete oocysts 3-10 days after ingesting tissue cysts/bradyzoites, > or = 18 days after ingesting oocysts, and > or = 13 days after ingesting tachyzoites."

    "abstract": "Blood transfusions are commonly administered to cats; associated risks include the transmission of various infectious diseases including Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf) and `Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' (Mhm). Blood transfusions in citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA-1) solution are commonly administered immediately or stored for up to 1 month prior to administration. It is unknown whether Mhf or Mhm survive in this solution or temperature. The purpose of this study was to determine if Mhf or Mhm remain viable after storage in CPDA-1 for varying periods of time. The results provide evidence that transmission of hemoplasmas to naive cats occurs after administration of infected feline blood that has been stored in CPDA-1 solution for 1 h (Mhf) and 1 week (Mhm). These findings support the recommendation that cats used as blood donors be screened for Mhf and Mhm infections by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay prior to use."

    "abstract": "Predation is increasingly pointed out as one of the factors contributing to population declines of ground-nesting farmland birds, though it remains poorly understood how ongoing transformations of agricultural landscapes affect predator assemblages. This study addressed this issue, estimating the contribution of landscape composition and configuration to spatial variation in species richness and abundances of mammalian carnivores across a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Portugal. The carnivore assemblage was diverse (10 species), but it was largely dominated by just three widespread and abundant species of generalist predators: domestic dog (Canis familiaris), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon). The number of domestic carnivore species and the abundance of cats (Felis catus) increased along with farmland occupation by human dwellings, whereas dogs were not responsive to landscape variables. The species richness of wild carnivores was highest in landscapes with a patchwork of arable fields and semi-natural habitats such as forests and shrubland, though it was also high in irrigated landscapes with dense networks of irrigation channels and tree lines bordering agricultural fields. Irrigation was also positively associated with the abundance of otters (Lutra lutra) and mongooses. Cats, foxes, badgers (Meles meles), and total and wild carnivore abundances, were positively affected by increasing cover by eucalyptus and pine forest plantations. In general, results suggest that the highest diversity and abundance of carnivores in Mediterranean farmland may occur in mosaic landscapes with small agricultural fields, high cover by woody vegetation patches and corridors, and many human dwellings. Preventing scrub encroachment and afforestation may thus be necessary to maintain a low predation risk in open farmland habitats, which are often inhabited by ground-nesting birds of high conservation concern. Conversely, keeping shrubland and forest patches within farmed landscapes may be essential where carnivore persistence is a relevant conservation goal. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "abstract": "This study investigated relationships between plasma leptin, insulin concentrations, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in lean and overweight cats. Leptin concentrations were measured in 16 cats during glucose tolerance tests before and after gaining weight, and after feeding a test meal in overweight cats. An important finding of this study is that in both lean (r=-0.79) and overweight (r=-0.89) cats, the higher the leptin concentrations, the more insulin resistant the cat, independent of the degree of adiposity. Leptin concentrations at baseline and after consuming a meal tended to be higher in overweight cats with glucose intolerance, compared to overweight cats with normal glucose tolerance, although the difference was not significant. After feeding the test meal to overweight cats in the early morning, plasma leptin concentrations initially decreased before subsequently rising to peak 15 h later, which coincided with late evening. The leptin peak occurred 9 h after the insulin peak following ingestion of the test meal. Importantly, this study suggests that increased leptin concentrations may contribute to the diminished insulin sensitivity seen in overweight cats. Alternatively, the compensatory hyperinsulinaemia found with insulin resistance in overweight cats could stimulate leptin production."

    "abstract": "INFORMATION processing in the cerebral cortex invariably involves the activation of millions of neurons that are widely distributed over its various areas, These distributed activity patterns need to be integrated into coherent representational states, A candidate mechanism for the integration and coordination of neuronal activity between different brain regions is synchronization on a fine temporal scale(1-3). In the visual cortex, synchronization occurs selectively between the responses of neurons that represent related features(2-5) and that need to be integrated for the generation of coherent percepts; neurons in other areas of the cerebral cortex also synchronize their discharges(6-10). However, little is known about the patterns and the behavioural correlates of synchrony among widely separated cortical regions, Here we report that synchronization occurs between areas of the visual and parietal cortex, and between areas of the parietal and motor cortex, in the awake cat, When cats responded to a sudden change of a visual pattern, neuronal activity in cortical areas exhibited synchrony without time lags; this synchrony was particularly strong between areas subserving related functions, During reward and inter-trial episodes, zero-time-lag synchrony was lost and replaced by interactions exhibiting large and unsystematic time lags."

    "abstract": "Group recommender systems introduce a whole set of new challenges for recommender systems research. The notion of generating a set of recommendations that will satisfy a group of users with potentially competing in- terests is challenging in itself. In addition to this we must consider how to record and combine the prefer- ences of many different users as they engage in simulta- neous recommendation dialogs. In this paper we intro- duce a group recommender system, called CATS, that is designed to provide assistance to a group of friends try- ing the plan a skiing vacation. The system uses the DiamondTouch interactive tabletop to allow up to 4 users to simultaneously engage in parallel recommendation ses- sions and we describe how personal and shared profiles and interaction spaces can be managed to generate sets of recommendations for the individual and the group."

    "abstract": "Opossums (Didelphis marsupialis), act as intermediate hosts for Besnoitia darlingi and could be infected orally with sporozoites (oocysts) and bradyzoites (tissue cysts), or intraperitoneally (i.p.) with tachyzoites. Infections could presumably be transmitted through cannibalism. Cats (Felis catus), the definitive host, could be infected only with bradyzoites but not sporozoites. Oocysts shed by cats measure about 12 x 12 μm, resemble similarly sized oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii and Hammondia hammondi, and must be differentiated by the appearance of tissue cysts after experimental infection of intermediate hosts. Cats did not form tissue cysts of B. darlingi. Tachyzoites from the related B. jellisoni could be used in the Sabin-Feldman dye test to determine the development of antibody to B. darlingi in opossums after infection."

    "abstract": "The medical records of 62 cats with clinical signs of central nervous system disease and accompanying inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were examined retrospectively to determine if signalment, clinical signs, CSF analysis and ancillary testing could accurately predict the type of central nervous system disease that was present. An inflammatory CSF was defined as one in which a total nucleated cell count was greater than 5 cells/microl or one in which the total nucleated cell count was normal but the nucleated cell differential count was abnormal. Sex, degree of CSF inflammation, neuroanatomical location and systemic signs provided little contributory information to the final diagnosis. In 63% of the cases a presumptive diagnosis could be made based on a combination of clinical signs, clinicopathological data and ancillary diagnostic tests. CSF analysis alone was useful only in the diagnosis of cats with feline infectious peritonitis, Cryptococcus species infection, lymphoma and trauma. Overall, despite extensive diagnostic evaluation, a specific diagnosis could not be made in 37% of cats. The prognosis for cats with inflammatory CSF was poor with 77% of cats surviving less than 1 year."

Thirty cats with a presurgical ultrasound examination an dconfirmed extrahepatic biliary obstruction were studied. A common bile duct diameter over 5 mm was present in 97% of the cats with extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Gallbladder dilation was seen in < 50% of the cats. Ultrasound identified all obstructive choleliths (calculus or plugs) in the common bile duct. However, neither common bile duct diameter nor appearance or any other ultrasonographic feature allowed differentiation between tumor and inflammation as the cause of obstruction. A short duration of clinical signs (10 days or less) seemed to be associated with obstructive cholelithiasis."

Some cats used in this study exhibited either no Toxoplasma antibodies or only low titers with the Sabin-Feldman-Test and in these cases infection was successful, oocysts were produced and the antibody titer rose. The highest antibody titers and the heaviest oocyst production were regularly found following infection with the Gail-strain. However cats with an antibody titer higher than 1:256 generally could not be successfully infected even with this strain. When the antibody titer related to the first infection had fallen the cats could be successfully reinfected and a normal oocyst production developed. One case of oocyst production in a naturally infected cat is described."

    "abstract": "Objective—To evaluate the long-term risks and bene- fits of early-age gonadectomy, compared with tradi- tional-age gonadectomy, among cats adopted from a large animal shelter. Design—Retrospective cohort study. Animals—1,660 cats. Procedure—Cats underwent gonadectomy and were adopted from an animal shelter before 1 year of age; follow-up was available for as long as 11 years after surgery (median follow-up time, 3.9 years). Adopters completed a questionnaire about their cats’ behavior and medical history. When possible, the cats’ veteri- nary records were reviewed. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify any associations between the occurrence of 47 medical and behavioral conditions and the cats’ age at gonadectomy. Results—Among male cats that underwent early-age gonadectomy (< 5.5 months of age), the occurrence of abscesses, aggression toward veterinarians, sexu- al behaviors, and urine spraying was decreased, whereas hiding was increased, compared with cats that underwent gonadectomy at an older age. Among male and female cats that underwent early-age gonadectomy, asthma, gingivitis, and hyperactivity were decreased, whereas shyness was increased. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Gonadecto- my before 5.5 months of age was not associated with increased rates of death or relinquishment or occurrence of any serious medical or behavioral con- dition and may provide certain important long-term benefits, especially for male cats. Animal shelters can safely gonadectomize cats at a young age, and veterinarians should consider recommending routine gonadectomy for client-owned cats before the tradi- tional age of 6 to 8 months."

    "abstract": "The presence of spiral bacteria in the feline stomach has been recognized for over a century, but the identities and degrees of prevalence of such organisms in privately owned cats are still poorly documented. The aims of this study were (i) to adapt different diagnostic tools and evaluate their practicality for diagnosing feline gastric Helicobacter colonization, (ii) to determine the prevalence of gastric Helicobacter-like organisms in pet cats, (iii) to identify the feline species, and (iv) to correlate the presence of a Helicobacter infection with gastritis. Biopsy samples were taken gastroscopically from the antra and the corpora of clinically healthy pet cats. Helicobacter-like organisms were detected by Gram staining, Warthin-Starry staining, and rapid urease testing in biopsy specimens and by [13C]urea breath testing in 79, 77, 78, and 85% of cases, respectively. PCR analysis revealed that 78% of the cats (38 of 49) were infected by Helicobacter heilmannii; however, none of them was harboring Helicobacter pylori or Helicobacter felis. Culture was positive for one cat; the organism was identified as Helicobacter pametensis by dot blot DNA hybridization. By a combination of the detection methods, 91% of the pet cats were found to be Helicobacter positive. For 46 cats (79%) diagnostic tests were concordant. All cats showed mild to moderate gastritis in either the antrum or the corpus, regardless of the presence or density of gastric bacteria. In summary, pet cats are frequently colonized by H. heilmannii without a significant correlation between infection and degree of gastritis."

    "abstract": "Eighty-seven cats from the Glasgow area were investigated to determine the prevalence of leptospiral infection and possible resultant disease. Eight (9.2 per cent) of the cats reacted serologically with the antigens of three serovars. Five of the cats were seropositive to Leptospira hardjo, two to L autumnalis and one cat seroconverted to L icterohaemorrhagiae. A paired serum sample indicated a recent infection in one of the cats. The major clinical sign shown by this cat was ascites. Four of the cats were from rural areas. This appears to be the first report of a serological survey of leptospiral infection in cats in the Glasgow area."

Eight flea species (Adoratopsylla antiquorum antiquorum, Ctenocephalides felis felis, Polygenis atopus, Polygenis rimatus, Polygenis roberti roberti, Polygenis tripus, Rhopalopsyllus lugubris, and Rhopalopsyllus lutzi lutzi), and five tick species (Amblyomma aureolatum, Amblyomma cajennense, Amblyomma dubitatum, Ixodes loricatus, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) were collected from dogs, cats, and opossums. Rickettsia felis was the only rickettsia found infecting fleas, whereas Rickettsia bellii was the only agent infecting ticks, but no animal or human blood was shown to contain rickettsial DNA. Testing animal and human sera by indirect immunofluorescence assay against four rickettsia antigens (R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. felis, and R. bellii), some opossum, dog, horse, and human sera reacted to R. rickettsii with titers at least four-fold higher than to the other three rickettsial antigens. These sera were considered to have a predominant antibody response to R. rickettsii. Using the same criteria, opossum, dog, and horse sera showed predominant antibody response to R. parkeri or a very closely related genotype. Our serological results suggest that both R. rickettsii and R. parkeri infected animals and/or humans in the studied areas."

    "abstract": "Among the most critical parameters for any drug candidate are tolerability, dose, solubility and permeability. For controlled release formulations, gastrointestinal transit is an added hurdle. While we might assume that intestinal transit is independent of the drug candidate, the relative importance of gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) depends directly on the other parameters. For example, a formulation of a drug with low solubility (LS) and/or low permeability (LP) characteristics might provide the required systemic concentrations when administered with food, but not if administered on an empty stomach. In the LS case, the drug may require the solubilizing effects of increased fluid and bile salts that accompany the meal. Likewise, a controlled release formulation of a drug with a region of preferred absorption may empty from the fasted stomach and move beyond the region before drug release is complete. Companion animals (e.g. cats and dogs) differ from humans and each other with respect to GITT, food effects, eating habit influences, breed and size variability, gastric pH, intestinal enzymes, GI permeability and absorption regions. This review examines how the anatomy and physiology of companion animals relates to the performance of orally administered immediate and controlled release formulations. Examples are presented of techniques used to predict the dose and acceptable solubility of drug candidates, and the performance of formulations in companion animals."

    "abstract": "1. We have recorded from 306 neurons in the inferior olive of six alert cats. Most of the cats were trained to perform a simple task with the forelimb. We observed the neural responses to a wide variety of cutaneous and proprioceptive stimuli, as well as responses during spontaneous and learned active movements. 2. Neurons responsive to somatosensory stimulation were found in all parts of the inferior olive, and they were roughly evenly divided between those responsive to cutaneous stimulation those responsive to proprioceptive stimulation. In the dorsal accessory olive all neurons were responsive to somatosensory stimulation. In the medial accessory nucleus 88% and in the principal olive 74% of cells were responsive to somatosensory stimulation. 3. Cells responsive to cutaneous stimulation usually had small receptive fields, commonly on the paw. These cells had low-threshold responses to one or more forms of cutaneous stimulation and typically fired one spike at the onset of the stimulus on 80% or more of stimulus applications. 4. Cells responsive to proprioceptive stimulation most commonly responded to passive displacements of a limb. These cells were often very sensitive, responding to linear displacements of <1 cm in one specific direction. 5. No cells in our sample responded reliably during active movement by the animal. Only 21% of cells responding to passive proprioceptive stimulation showed any modulation during active movement, and the modulation was weak. Likewise, cells responsive to cutaneous stimulation generally failed to respond when a similar stimulus was produced by an active movement by the animal. Exceptions to this were stimuli produced during exploratory movements or when the receptive field unexpectedly made contact with an object during active movement. 6. Electrical stimulation applied in the inferior olive failed to evoke movement or to modify ongoing movement. 7. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that inferior olivary neurons function as somatic event detectors responding particularly reliably to unexpected stimuli."

Medical records of 12 animals (five dogs and seven cats) undergoing surgical management of chylothorax from 2001 to 2005 were reviewed. All animals received thoracic duct ligation and thoracic omentalization. In some cases, a combination of subtotal pericardectomy and/or pleural stripping was also employed. All animals survived surgery, and none was lost to follow-up. Median survival time for cats was 209 days (range 2 to 1328 days), and for dogs it was 211 days (range 7 to 991 days). Although postoperative mortality was higher than in other recent studies, no complications could be directly attributed to thoracic omentalization. A controlled, prospective study is needed to compare outcomes of this management method to those of other methods."

    "abstract": "Exposure to sound of sufficient duration and level causes permanent damage to the peripheral auditory system, which results in the reorganization of the cortical tonotopic map. The changes are such that neurons with pre-exposure tuning to frequencies in the hearing loss range now become tuned to frequencies near the near-normal lower boundary of the hearing loss range, which thus becomes over represented. However, cats exposed to a traumatizing noise and immediately thereafter placed for a few weeks in an enriched acoustic environment presented a much-restricted hearing loss compared with similarly exposed cats that were placed for the same time in a quiet environment. The enriched environment spectrally matched the expected hearing loss range and was approximately 40 dB above the level of the expected hearing loss. The hearing loss in the quiet environment-reared cats ranged from 6 to 32 kHz with the largest loss (on average, 40 dB) ranging from 24 to 32 kHz. In contrast, the hearing loss in the enriched-environment cats was restricted to 6-8 kHz at a level of, on average, 35 dB and with 16-32 kHz having normal thresholds. Despite the remaining hearing loss for the enriched-environment cats in the 6-8 kHz range, plastic tonotopic map changes in primary auditory cortex could no longer be demonstrated, suggesting that the enriched acoustic environment prevents this reorganization. This finding has implications for the treatment of hearing disorders, such as tinnitus, that have been linked to cortical tonotopic map reorganization."

The procedure involves subcutaneous injection of dilute formalin into the forepaw, after which the animal's responses are rated according to objective behavioral criteria. The formalin test is a statistically valid technique which has two advantages over other pain tests: (1) little or no restraint is necessary, permitting unhindered observation of the complete range of behavioral responses; and (2) the pain stimulus is continuous rather than transient, thus bearing greater resemblance to most clinical pain. The analgesic effects of morphine, meperidine, and stimulation of the periaqueductal grey matter are evaluated using this test."

    "abstract": "The flat interface nerve electrode (FINE) is an attempt to improve the stimulation selectivity of extraneural electrodes. By reshaping peripheral nerves into elliptical cylinders, central fibers are moved closer to the nerve-electrode interface, and additional surface area is created for contact placement. The goals of this study were to test the hypothesis that greater nerve reshaping leads to improved selectivity and to examine the chronic recruitment properties of the FINE. Three FINEs were developed to reshape peripheral nerves to different degrees. Four electrodes of each type were implanted on the sciatic nerves of 12 cats and tested for selectivity over at least three months. There was physiologic evidence of nerve injury in two cats with the tightest cuffs, but the other animals behaved normally. All cuff types were capable of selectively activating branches of the sciatic nerve, as well as groups of fibers within branches. The electrodes that moderately reshaped the nerves demonstrated the most selectivity. Both the selectivity measurements and the recruitment curve characteristics were stable throughout the implant period. From an electrophysiological standpoint, the FINE is a viable alternative for neuroprosthetic devices. A histological analysis of the nerves is under way to evaluate the safety of the FINE."

    "abstract": "Summary Two days after castration, urinary free felinine plus N-acetylfelinine decreased 24% in male cats, but, by day 5, the concentration had not decreased to that routinely found in males that have been castrated for several months. In a second experiment, three groups of castrated adult male cats received different subcutaneous injections: control (carrier), testosterone, testosterone plus estradiol. A fourth group of intact adult female cats received a testosterone injection. Urine was collected and analysed for free felinine, N-acetylfelinine and 3-methylbutanolglutathione. Baseline blood testosterone and estradiol concentrations were low during the pre-period, but increased sharply after hormone injections. The concentration of all three urinary metabolites increased as a result of testosterone injections with estradiol not modulating the effect. The effect of testosterone was not gender dependent. The concentration of free felinine, N-acetylfelinine and 3-methylbutanolglutathione in the urine remained low in the placebo control group throughout the study. The relative molar contribution of free felinine to the total amount of felinine containing compounds increased due to testosterone treatment, while the contribution of 3-methylbutanolglutathione and N-acetylfelinine decreased. Testosterone increases free felinine, N-acetylfelinine and 3-methylbutanolglutathione excretion in castrated adult male and intact female cats, whereas estradiol does not modulate this effect."

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine whether the use-dependent malleability of visual cortex functions which is particularly pronounced in 4-week-old kittens correlates with enhanced susceptibility to kindling. For that purpose the effects of high-frequency electrical stimulation were compared in the visual cortex of 4-week-old kittens and of adult cats. The striate cortex of one hemisphere was stimulated with a single train of pulses whose intensity was set just above the threshold for the elicitation of afterdischarges (ADs). In kittens the AD thresholds were consistently higher than in adults and with repeated stimulation, the ADs tended to disorganize, to decrease in amplitude and duration and to become more restricted to the site of stimulation after about 6 stimulations. In the adult, by contrast, the ADs remained well organized and constant in duration throughout 30 stimulations. They showed an increase in amplitude and spike frequency and spread with increasing consistency to the other hemisphere. No electrographic or behavioural signs of epileptic activity developed in kittens, while in adults ADs were on occasion followed by irregular spike activity associated with behavioural states resembling absences. We conclude that the visual cortex possesses powerful mechanisms to prevent the development of supracritical excitatory states, these mechanisms being more effective in the kitten than in the adult. ?? 1986."

The present study examined the extent to which compensatory changes in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) gene and protein expression may underlie this behavioral recovery. In normal cats, TH and DAT protein levels were higher in the dorsal vs. ventral striatum. Expression of DAT and TH mRNA was higher in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) than in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In symptomatic parkinsonian animals, DAT and TH protein levels were significantly decreased in all striatal areas studied. TH and DAT mRNA expression in residual SNc neurons were decreased a mean 32% and 38%, respectively. DAT gene expression in residual VTA neurons in symptomatic animals was decreased 30% whereas TH gene expression was unaffected. In spontaneously recovered cats, TH protein levels were significantly higher than the levels in symptomatic cats only in the ventral striatum, whereas no increase in DAT protein levels were observed in any striatal area. Residual neurons in most ventral mesencephalic regions of recovered cats had increased TH mRNA expression but not increased DAT gene expression, compared with symptomatic animals. Thus, increased TH protein and mRNA and suppression of DAT protein and mRNA expression in the striatum and ventral mesencephalon were associated with functional recovery from MPTP-induced parkinsonism."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of Toxoplasma infection in wild mammals, particularly noncarnivorous species, and to identify possible sources of infection for humans. A serological study was conducted that included 310 animals representing 10 species of terrestrial mammals from the same region (primary tropical rain forest inhabited by humans). Toxoplasmosis was diagnosed using a direct agglutination test using formalin-treated Toxoplasma gondii. The prevalence of antibodies for toxoplasmosis differed greatly between species and ranged from 0% to 62%. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis was zero or very low for tree-dwelling animals, which included sloth, porcupine, and howler monkey. Conversely, the prevalence of infection was 46-62% among granivores, insectivores, and burrowing animals, such as peccary, paca, and armadillo. We conclude that wild mammals in French Guiana constitute a reservoir of T. gondii parasites. Given the absence of domestic cats from the forest, noncarnivorous species may be infected by the ingestion of oocysts that are eliminated into the soil or water in the stools of wild cats and then dispersed."

    "abstract": "Lymphatic filariasis has been targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be eliminated by the year 2020. In addition to chemotherapy and vector control, the control of reservoir hosts is necessary for the control program to succeed. Malayan filariasis, caused by Brugia malayi, is endemic in the South of Thailand where domestic cats serve as the major reservoir host. However, in nature, domestic cats also carry B. pahangi, Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens infections and it is difficult to distinguish the different filarial species from each other just by morphology. To assess the burden of filarial parasites, we performed a study on domestic cats in an endemic area of malayan filariasis in the Prasang district, of Surat Thani, a province in Southern Thailand. Together with Giemsa staining and acid phosphatase activity studies, we performed PCR-RFLP analysis on the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). PCR-RFLP with Ase I could clearly differentiate between B. malayi, B. pahangi, D. immitis and D. repens. Out of the 52 cats studied, filarial parasites were identified in 5 (9.5%) cats, of which 4 (7.6%) were B. pahangi and 1 (1.9%) D. immitis. This PCR-RFLP technique detected two additional cats that were not detected by microscopy. The domestic cats are not an important host of B. malayi in this region. We could develop the PCR-RFLP assay test for differentiating filarial nematodes which can be applied to survey human, animal reservoir hosts and mosquito vectors in endemic areas."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe and evaluate the use of corneoconjunctival transposition as a surgical treatment for corneal sequestra in cats. ANIMALS STUDIED: Fifteen cats (17 eyes) of various breeds and ages with corneal sequestra treated surgically with corneoconjunctival transposition. PROCEDURE: Retrospective medical records study. RESULTS: Median age was 39 months. Eight patients were castrated males, five were spayed females, and two were intact females. The left eye was affected in eight cats, the right eye was affected in five cats, and both eyes were affected in two cats. Mean (+/- SD) sequestrum diameter was 4.4 +/- 2.4 mm (range 1-10 mm) and the sequestrum was located centrally in all cases. Sequestra occurred in the superficial stroma in 8/17 corneas, in the anterior one third of the stroma in 3/17 corneas, and in the middle one third of the stroma in 6/17 corneas. Median duration of clinical signs prior to presentation was 39 days (range 14-1095 days). Median time to healing, defined as the number of days from surgery to cessation of medical treatment, was 34 days (range 25-86 days). There were no recurrences and minimal scar formation. CONCLUSIONS: Corneoconjunctival transposition is a valid procedure for surgical treatment of corneal sequestra in cats. The procedure results in excellent cosmesis and functional vision with no recurrences."

    "abstract": "We studied neurons in areas V1, V2, and posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area (PMLS) of anesthetized cats, assessing their speed tuning using steps to constant speeds and acceleration and deceleration tuning using speed ramps. The results show that the speed tuning of neurons in all three cortical areas is highly dependent on prior motion history, with early responses during speed steps tuned to higher speeds than later responses. The responses to speed ramps are profoundly influenced by speed-dependent response latencies and ongoing changes in neuronal speed tuning due to adaptation. Acceleration evokes larger transient and sustained responses than subsequent deceleration of the same rate with this disparity increasing with ramp rate. Consequently, there was little correlation between preferred speeds measured using speed steps, acceleration or deceleration. From 146 recorded cells, the proportion of cells that were clearly speed tuned ranged from 69 to 100% across the three brain areas. However, only 13 cells showed good skewed Gaussian fits and systematic variation in their responses to a range of accelerations. Although suggestive of acceleration coding, this apparent tuning was attributable to a cell's speed tuning and the different stimulus durations at each acceleration rate. Thus while the majority of cells showed speed tuning, none unequivocally showed acceleration tuning. The results are largely consistent with an existing model that predicts responses to accelerating stimuli developed for macaque MT, which showed that the responses to acceleration can be decoded if adaptation is taken into account. However, the present results suggest future models should include stimulus-specific adaptation and speed-dependent response latencies."

    "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that treatment with the 5-HT(1A/7) receptor agonist [(R)-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino]tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) increases bladder capacity in chloralose-anesthetized female cats with chronic spinal cord injury. In the current study, we investigated the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on bladder capacity and external urethral sphincter (EUS) activity in urethane-anesthetized female rats (initial body mass 175-200 g) with chronic spinal cord injury (transsection at T10). Cystometric study took place 8-12 wk posttranssection. Intravesical pressure was monitored in urethane-anesthetized rats with a transvesical catheter, and EUS activity was assessed electromyographically. Spinal cord injury disrupts phasic activity of the EUS, resulting in decreased voiding efficiency and increased residual volume. 8-OH-DPAT induced a dose-dependent decrease in bladder capacity (the opposite of its effect in chronic spinal cord-injured cats) with an increase in micturition volume and decrease in residual volume resulting from improvement in voiding efficiency. The unexpected improvement in voiding efficiency can be explained by the 8-OH-DPAT-induced emergence of phasic EUS relaxation. Phasic EUS relaxation was also altered by 8-OH-DPAT in spinally intact rats, whereas the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist N-tert-butyl-3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-2-phenylpropanamide (WAY-100635), on its own, was without effect. It remains to be determined when phasic relaxation is restored after spinal cord injury, and indeed whether it is ever truly lost or is only temporarily separated from excitatory input."

We investigated the effects of (R)-8-OH-DPAT and GR-46611 on bladder activity in chronic spinal cord injured cats during infusion of dilute acetic acid into the bladder to stimulate chemosensitive bladder afferent C fibers (acid infused, spinal cord injured cats). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chloralose anesthetized, spinal cord injured cats were catheterized through the bladder dome for filling cystometry during 0.5% acetic acid infusion. Dose-response curves for (R)-8-OH-DPAT (0.3 to 30 microg/kg intravenously) or GR-46611 (0.03 to 300 microg/kg intravenously) were followed by the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) antagonist WAY-100635 (N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazin-1-yl)-2-phenylpropanamide) (Sigma) (300 microg/kg). Threshold volume, bladder capacity, residual volume, micturition volume and arterial pressure were measured and external urethral sphincter electromyogram was recorded. RESULTS: Acid infused, spinal cord injured cats responded to (R)-8-OH-DPAT but not to GR-46611 with dose dependent increases in threshold volume, capacity and residual volume (significant above 3 microg/kg). Effects of (R)-8-OH-DPAT were largely reversed by WAY-100635. Neither (R)-8-OH-DPAT nor GR-46611 augmented external urethral sphincter electromyogram activity. CONCLUSIONS: Based on differences in the response to GR-46611 in saline vs acid infused, spinal cord injured animals it is tempting to speculate that 2 distinct populations of bladder afferent C fibers (1 chemosensitive and 1 mechanosensitive) can initiate spinal bladder reflexes. Because 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptor agonists increased bladder capacity under saline or acid infused conditions, they are promising candidates for decreasing bladder hyperactivity and increasing bladder capacity in patients with chronic spinal cord injury."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the spike patterns of cortical neurons vary systematically as a function of sound-source location such that the response of a single neuron can signal the location of a sound source throughout 360 degrees of azimuth. The present study examined specific features of spike patterns that might transmit information related to sound-source location. Analysis was based on responses of well-isolated single units recorded from cortical area A2 in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats. Stimuli were 80-ms noise bursts presented from loudspeakers in the horizontal plane; source azimuths ranged through 360 degrees in 20 degrees steps. Spike patterns were averaged across samples of eight trials. A competitive artificial neural network (ANN) identified sound-source locations by recognizing spike patterns; the ANN was trained using the learning vector quantization learning rule. The information about stimulus location that was transmitted by spike patterns was computed from joint stimulus-response probability matrices. Spike patterns were manipulated in various ways to isolate particular features. Full-spike patterns, which contained all spike-count information and spike timing with 100-micros precision, transmitted the most stimulus-related information. Transmitted information was sensitive to disruption of spike timing on a scale of more than approximately 4 ms and was reduced by an average of approximately 35% when spike-timing information was obliterated entirely. In a condition in which all but the first spike in each pattern were eliminated, transmitted information decreased by an average of only approximately 11%. In many cases, that condition showed essentially no loss of transmitted information. Three unidimensional features were extracted from spike patterns. Of those features, spike latency transmitted approximately 60% more information than that transmitted either by spike count or by a measure of latency dispersion. Information transmission by spike patterns recorded on single trials was substantially reduced compared with the information transmitted by averages of eight trials. In a comparison of averaged and nonaveraged responses, however, the information transmitted by latencies was reduced by only approximately 29%, whereas information transmitted by spike counts was reduced by 79%. Spike counts clearly are sensitive to sound-source location and could transmit information about sound-source locations. Nevertheless, the present results demonstrate that the timing of the first poststimulus spike carries a substantial amount, probably the majority, of the location-related information present in spike patterns. The results indicate that any complete model of the cortical representation of auditory space must incorporate the temporal characteristics of neuronal response patterns."

    "abstract": "The present study sought to determine the spectrum of diseases associated with subnormal concentrations of serum cobalamin in cats undergoing investigation of suspected gastrointestinal problems. The solid-phase boil radioassay (RA) for cobalamin employed in the present study was immunologically specific, precise, and accurate, with a sensitivity of 15 pg/mL. The RA yielded results that strongly correlated with those obtained by bioassay (Spearmann rho = .805; P < .0001), although the absolute values were lower for the RA. Forty-nine of 80 serum samples submitted during the period of January 1996-January 1998 had cobalamin concentrations below the reference range for healthy cats (range 900-2,800 pg/mL; mean +/- SD, 1,775 +/- 535 pg/mL; n = 33). Cats with subnormal cobalamin concentrations (mean +/- SD; 384 +/- 272 pg/mL, range 3-883 pg/mL) were middle-aged or older and were presented for weight loss. diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and thickened intestines. Definitive diagnoses in 22 cats included inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), intestinal lymphoma, cholangiohepatitis or cholangits, and pancreatic inflammation. Serum concentrations of cobalamin were particularly low in cats with intestinal lymphoma, three-fifths of whom also had subnormal serum concentrations of folate (< 9 ng/mL). The simultaneous presence of disease in the intestines, pancreas, or hepatobiliary system in many cats made it difficult to determine the cause of subnormal cobalamin concentrations. The circulating half-life of parenteral cyanocobalamin was shorter in 2 cats with IBD (5 days) than in 4 healthy cats (12.75 days). The presence of subnormal serum concentrations of cobalamin in 49 of 80 cats evaluated suggests that the measurement of serum cobalamin may be a useful indirect indicator of enteric or pancreatic disease in cats. The rapid depletion of circulating cobalamin in cats suggests that cats may be highly susceptible to cobalamin deficiency. However, the relationship of subnormal serum cobalamin concentrations to cobalamin deficiency and the effect of cobalamin deficiency on cats remain to be determined."

METHOD: Cats with abscesses or wounds were enrolled. Cats (217) were randomised to treatment with either cefovecin administered by subcutaneous injection at 14 day intervals or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as twice-daily oral tablets for 14 days. Treatment courses were repeated at 14 day intervals, when deemed necessary. Clinicians assessing lesions were masked to treatment allocation. Only animals with a confirmed pretreatment bacterial pathogen were included in the efficacy analysis. Cases were evaluated 28 days after initiation of the final course of treatment. RESULTS: Cefovecin was as efficacious as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and efficacy was 100 per cent for both treatments. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Cefovecin, administered as a single subcutaneous injection repeated at 14 day intervals as required, was shown to be as efficacious as oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the treatment of abscesses/wounds in cats."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize clinical and clinicopathologic findings, response to treatment, and causes of systemic hypertension in cats with hypertensive retinopathy. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 69 cats with hypertensive retinopathy. PROCEDURE: Medical records from cats with systemic hypertension and hypertensive retinopathy were reviewed. RESULTS: Most cats (68.1%) were referred because of vision loss; retinal detachment, hemorrhage, edema, and degeneration were common findings. Cardiac abnormalities were detected in 37 cats, and neurologic signs were detected in 20 cats. Hypertension was diagnosed concurrently with chronic renal failure (n = 22), hyperthyroidism (5), diabetes mellitus (2), and hyperaldosteronism (1). A clearly identifiable cause for hypertension was not detected in 38 cats; 26 of these cats had mild azotemia, and 12 did not have renal abnormalities. Amlodipine decreased blood pressure in 31 of 32 cats and improved ocular signs in 18 of 26 cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Retinal lesions, caused predominantly by choroidal injury, are common in cats with hypertension. Primary hypertension in cats may be more common than currently recognized. Hypertension should be considered in older cats with acute onset of blindness; retinal edema, hemorrhage, or detachment; cardiac disease; or neurologic abnormalities. Cats with hypertension-induced ocular disease should be evaluated for renal failure, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac abnormalities. Blood pressure measurements and funduscopic evaluations should be performed routinely in cats at risk for hypertension (preexisting renal disease, hyperthyroidism, and age > 10 years). Amlodipine is an effective antihypertensive agent in cats."

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate three psychophysical tests for the measurement of contrast sensitivity (CS) and disability glare (DG) at different luminance levels. METHODS: In 60 eyes of 60 individuals (group 1: 20 healthy eyes of young individuals; group 2: 20 healthy eyes of elderly subjects; group 3: 20 eyes with nuclear cataract), CS with best correction was measured twice with the Frankfurt-Freiburg Contrast and Acuity Test System (FF-CATS) and the Functional Acuity Contrast Test (FACT, 1.5 cycles per degree [cpd]) at 167 cd/m2 and 0.167 cd/m2, and with the Pelli-Robson Chart (PRC) at 100 cd/m2 with and without glare. Repeatability of test and retest, and discriminative ability between the different subgroups, were assessed for CS values. RESULTS: Maximum CS values varied across tests. In all groups, highest CS values were obtained with the photopic FF-CATS. For FACT scores at 1.5 cpd, there was a ceiling effect for young subjects. CS scores obtained with the PRC were the lowest. The PRC had the best test-retest repeatability of all tests. Under mesopic conditions with glare, reliability was generally lower; the FF-CATS had the highest repeatability of the mesopic tests. The FF-CATS discriminated best between the different groups for all conditions. CONCLUSIONS: There are large discrepancies in the test results between CS testing methods, especially under different lighting conditions. Results from different CS tests are not interchangeable."

Most Bartonella species that infect cats are zoonotic. Cats are the mammalian reservoir and vector for Bartonella henselae, an important zoonotic agent. Cat fleas transmit Bartonella among cats, and cats with fleas are an important source of human B henselae infections. New information about Bartonella as feline pathogens has recently been published, and this article summarizes much of that information. Issues surrounding diagnosis and treatment of feline Bartonella infections are described, and prevention of zoonotic transmission of Bartonella is discussed."

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT : Rickettsia felis is an obligate intracellular bacterium belonging to the spotted fever group, suspected to cause a murine typhus-like illness in humans, with a cosmopolitan distribution. This study was designed to estimate presence and occurrence of this pathogen in fleas collected from dogs and cats in different areas of Italy. Two species of fleas were identified, Ctenocephalides felis (80.3%) and Ctenocephalides canis (19.7%).Overall, 320 fleas (257 C. felis and 63 C. canis) collected from 117 animals (73 dogs and 44 cats) were tested. Thirty-eight (11.9%) C. felis fleas, 13 from cats (17.6%) and 25 from dogs (10.2%) were positive for R. felis. No C. canis was positive. Fleas from cats showed a tendency to be more positive than fleas from dogs. Prevalence of R. felis among areas and within provinces of the same area was extremely variable, ranging from 0 to 35.3%. Overall, prevalence in north-eastern Italy (23.2%) was significantly higher than in south-western Italy (7.1%). This study confirmed the occurrence of R. felis in cat and dog fleas (C. felis) from Italy, similar to other European countries. The results also suggest that R. felis should be considered in the human differential diagnosis of any spotted-like fever in Italy, especially if the patient is known to have been exposed to flea bites."

Thus, \"trap-neuter-release\" (TNR) programs have been carried out for > 10 years. In this paper we present data on registered colonies and censused cats in Rome from 1991 to 2000; the results of the neutering campaign from 1991 to 2000; and a survey, on 103 cat colonies, on the effects of demographic control of urban feral-cat colonies in the city of Rome, carried out by the local Veterinary Public Services (VPS) in collaboration with the associations of cat care-takers. In 10 years almost 8000 were neutered and reintroduced in their original colony. The spay/neuter campaigns brought about a general decrease in cat number but the percentage of cat immigration (due to abandonment and spontaneous arrival) is around 21%. This suggests that all these efforts without an effective education of people to control the reproduction of house cats (as a prevention for abandonment) are a waste of money, time and energy.

    "abstract": "Cats were used to assess the significance of differences in animal preparations in the study of anesthetic-induced analgesia. Comparison was made between pentobarbital-anesthetized and decerebrate non-anesthetized cats. Bradykinin dissolved in normal saline was injected into the femoral artery as a noxious stimulus, and the neural response in the spinal cord lateral funiculus was recorded using the multi-unit activity technique. The magnitude of the neural response and the changes in spontaneous firing were compared before and after cervical cord transection at C1. Before the transection, the response was greater in anesthetized than in decerebrate cats. The cord transection potentiated the response in both preparations, but the degree of potentiation was greater in decerebrate than in anesthetized cats. These studies confirmed the presence of a descending pain inhibition system acting tonically on the nociceptive neural mechanisms in the spinal cord, and indicated the susceptibility of this system to pentobarbital. We conclude that pretreatment with pentobarbital induces pharmacologically a state of partial spinal cord transection and reduces the effects of drugs acting through supraspinal CNS structures."

Due to biohazard concerns associated with lomustine capsule reformulation, a standardized 10-mg capsule dosage was used for all cats regardless of body weight. Severe hematological toxicity was infrequent, with the incidence of either grade III or IV neutropenia and thrombocytopenia being 4.1% and 1.0%, respectively. Cats receiving higher cumulative doses of lomustine trended toward a greater likelihood for progressive neutropenia (P=0.07). Two cats with lymphoma, two cats with fibrosarcoma, and one cat with multiple myeloma achieved a measurable partial response to lomustine therapy. Cats treated with higher dosages of lomustine trended toward statistically significant higher response rates (P=0.07)."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study addressed the general hypothesis that abnormalities of the mitral valve apparatus are common in cats with idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and contribute to dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: 106 cats (28 controls and 78 with HCM) had transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography performed with quantification of 33 variables. Three groups of cats (control [Group-1], HCM without obstruction [Group-2], and HCM with obstruction [Group-3]) were identified and compared by analysis of variance, chi(2) analysis, and correlation analysis. RESULTS: Cats in Group-3 had more LV and papillary muscle hypertrophy, increased length of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, and a higher prevalence of false tendons in the LVOT compared to cats in Group-2 (P < or = 0.05). The length of the anterior mitral valve leaflet was correlated to the severity of dynamic obstruction (P < or = 0.05) and the magnitude of LV hypertrophy (P < or = 0.001). Systolic anterior motion of chordae tendineae (CAM) was observed in 16% of control cats and >50% of cats with HCM (P < or = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of the mitral valve are common in cats with HCM suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of dynamic outflow tract obstruction."

    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the population substructure of purebred dogs and cats in order to estimate the true significance of a microsatellite-based DNA match for use as evidence in legal proceedings. The high frequency of animal hair as a forensic evidence submission necessitates the development of mitochondrial analysis tools as well. METHODS: Random samples from a large convenience collection of veterinary diagnostic submissions from the western USA were used, as well as contributed samples of unrelated purebred cats and dogs. Dogs (n=558) were profiled with 17 microsatellites and the data evaluated for Hardy Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. The mitochondrial control region (D loop) of dogs (n=348) and cats (n=167) was sequenced to determine the haplotype distribution. RESULTS: Domestic dogs in the western United States showed significant population substructure with marked associations within loci but no disequilibrium between loci. A population substructure coefficient Theta=0.11 is recommended for calculating genotype frequencies. Mitochondrial haplotypes in cats and dogs show less variation than human haplotypes. CONCLUSION: Although population substructure occurs in domestic dogs (and can be inferred in cats), the discriminatory power of microsatellite analysis is dramatic with even partial DNA types, strongly supporting the prosecution of perpetrators in five discussed cases. Mitochondrial analysis, while less powerful, adds a layer of evidence in four discussed cases."

    "abstract": "The clinical records of 38 cats (1985-1995) with a neuropathologically confirmed diagnosis of necrosis of the hippocampus and occasionally the lobus piriformis were evaluated retrospectively. There was no sex or breed predisposition. Most cats were between 1 and 6 years of age (mean age 35 months) and had either generalized or complex-partial seizures of acute onset and rapid progression. The seizures had a tendency to become recurrent and to present as clusters or even status epilepticus later in the course of the disease. Fourteen cats died spontaneously, and 24 were euthanized. Histopathologic examination revealed bilateral lesions restricted to the hippocampus and occasionally the lobus piriformis. The lesions seemed to reflect different stages of the disease and consisted of acute neuronal degeneration to complete malacia, affecting mainly the layer of the large pyramidal cells but sometimes also the neurons of the dentate gyrus and the piriform lobe. The clinical, neuropathologic, and epidemiologic findings suggest that the seizures in these cats were triggered by primary structural brain damage, perhaps resulting from excitotoxicity. The cause remains unknown, but epidemiologic analysis suggests an environmental factor, probably a toxin."

Animals: Cats (n=16) with rostral mandibular body fracture (10 bilateral, 6 unilateral) just caudal to the canine teeth. Methods: Orthodontic wire (Dentaurum(®) ; 0.9 mm) was used as a lingual arch bar by contouring it to the shape of the lingual side of the alveolar margin, and secured by circum-mandibular wires passed interproximal to teeth. Stability of fixation, occlusion, tolerance to the lingual arch bar, degree of secondary gingivitis/periodontitis, and ability to eat were evaluated clinically, and fracture union was assessed radiographically. Results: The lingual arch bar was well tolerated. Eleven cats without a feeding tube were able to eat within 24 hours. Time to fracture union and appliance removal ranged from 28 to 64 days (mean, 42.5 days). Malocclusion of the rostral part of the fracture occurred in 5 cats; however only 1 required correction. Conclusions: Intraoral stabilization of rostral mandibular fractures using a lingual arch bar is a simple and effective method for the treatment of rostral mandibular fractures just caudal to the canine teeth."

    "abstract": "Increased encephalization, or larger brain volume relative to body mass, is a repeated theme in vertebrate evolution. Here we present an extensive sampling of relative brain sizes in fossil and extant taxa in the mammalian order Carnivora (cats, dogs, bears, weasels, and their relatives). By using Akaike Information Criterion model selection and endocranial volume and body mass data for 289 species (including 125 fossil taxa), we document clade-specific evolutionary transformations in encephalization allometries. These evolutionary transformations include multiple independent encephalization increases and decreases in addition to a remarkably static basal Carnivora allometry that characterizes much of the suborder Feliformia and some taxa in the suborder Caniformia across much of their evolutionary history, emphasizing that complex processes shaped the modern distribution of encephalization across Carnivora. This analysis also permits critical evaluation of the social brain hypothesis (SBH), which predicts a close association between sociality and increased encephalization. Previous analyses based on living species alone appeared to support the SBH with respect to Carnivora, but those results are entirely dependent on data from modern Canidae (dogs). Incorporation of fossil data further reveals that no association exists between sociality and encephalization across Carnivora and that support for sociality as a causal agent of encephalization increase disappears for this clade."

    "abstract": "The firing rate responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex grow with stimulus contrast, the variation in the luminance of an image relative to the mean luminance. These responses, however, are reduced after a cell is exposed for prolonged periods to high-contrast visual stimuli. This phenomenon, known as contrast adaptation, occurs in the cortex and is not present at earlier stages of visual processing. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying cortical adaptation, intracellular recordings were performed in the visual cortex of cats, and the effects of prolonged visual stimulation were studied. Surprisingly, contrast adaptation barely affected the stimulus-driven modulations in the membrane potential of cortical cells. Moreover, it did not produce sizable changes in membrane resistance. The major effect of adaptation, evident both in the presence and in the absence of a visual stimulus, was a tonic hyperpolarization. Adaptation affects a class of synaptic inputs, most likely excitatory in nature, that exert a tonic influence on cortical cells."

    "abstract": "The behavioural manipulation hypothesis posits that parasites can change the behaviour of hosts to increase the reproductive fitness of the parasite. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii fits this description well. Sexual reproduction occurs in the cat intestine, from which highly stable oocysts are excreted in faeces. Grazing animals, including rodents, can then ingest these oocysts. The parasite has evolved the capacity to abolish the innate fear that rodents have of the odours of cats, and to convert that fear into an attraction. This presumably increases the likelihood of the rodent being predated, thereby completing the parasite's life cycle. The behavioural syndrome produced by T. gondii does not have any precedent in neuroscience research. This is not a case where the normal functioning of fear system have been altered. This is not even the case of the altering of fear towards predator odours, while leaving other kinds of fear intact. This is an unprecedented example of one component of the fear being eliminated (and replaced by a novel attraction), while appearing to leave other domains unchanged. An understanding of the neurobiological effects of T. gondii is beginning to emerge. One possibility is T. gondii's preferential localisation to, and effects within the amygdala; this is particularly intriguing, given the role of this brain structure in the normal fear response. Obviously, far more must be understood, and the unique behavioural effects of T. gondii put very demanding constraints on any hypothesis we formulate to explain proximate neurobiological mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 of Asian origin continues to circulate in poultry and wild birds, causing considerable concern for veterinary and public health in Asia, Europe and Africa. Natural transmission of HPAIV H5N1 from poultry to humans, resulting in infections associated with high mortality, and from poultry or wild birds to large felids and domestic cats has been reported. Experimental infection of cats with HPAIV H5N1 derived from a human patient resulted in lethal disease. The role of cats in the adaptation of HPAIV H5N1 to mammals and vaccination regimens for the eventual protection of cats, however, remain to be elucidated. Here, it was shown that cats can be protected against a lethal high-dose challenge infection by an inactivated, adjuvanted heterologous H5N6 avian influenza virus vaccine. The challenge HPAIV H5N1 was derived from a naturally infected cat. In non-vaccinated cats, low-dose exposure resulted in asymptomatic infections with minimal virus excretion. As diseased cats can transmit the infection to naïve contact animals, the epidemiological role of H5N1-infected cats in endemically infected areas as a link between wild birds, poultry and humans needs close inspection, and vaccination of cats should be considered to reduce possible human exposure. © 2008 SGM."

    "abstract": "A retrospective epidemiological study about epidemiology of rabies in Chile between years 1989 and 2005 was done. A data base of 39793 national registries of rabies samples was analyzed by means of statistical packages. Out of 39793 analyzed cases, 719 bats, 7 dogs, 7 cats, 1 bovine and 1 human were positive to rabies throughout the 17 years of this study. The statistical analysis established a significant increase in the proportions of positivity in bats, with predominance of variant 4 between the reservoirs. Given the complexity of the wild cycle of the rabies in Chile, it is necessary to maintain a program control of rabies, directed to educate people for a responsible possession of domestic animals, due to the risk of rabies transmission from bat to the susceptible species."

Kittens were born in 8 months of the year with birth peaks in October-November and in January. Mean litter size was 2.7 and 80% of kittens born between August 1979 and January 1980 survived until June 1980. Kittens died from starvation and disease. In June 1980 51-56% of cats were <1 yr old. The number of cats is recovering rapidly from heavy culling. Depredation by cats is a potential threat to sea-bird colonies. An 'average' cat's annual diet included: 134 European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, 37 jackass penguins Spheniscus demersus, 25 Cape cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis, 31 other birds and 24 house mice Mus musculus. Each cat killed 105 rabbits and 13 birds each year, the balance of its diet being made up by carrion.-from Author"

    "abstract": "In the primary visual cortex (V1), the single-neuron response to a grating stimulus placed in the classical receptive field (CRF) is suppressed by a similar stimulus presented in the CRF surround. To assess the input mechanism underlying the surround suppression, we tested the effects of iontophoretically administered GABA(A)-receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI), for the 46 V1 neurons in anesthetized cats. First, the stimulus-size tuning curves were studied, with or without BMI administration, for each neuron by changing the size of the grating patch. During the BMI administration, the shape of the normalized size tuning curve did not change considerably. Second, the dependency of surround suppression on the orientation of the surround grating was examined. In the control, the surround suppression showed the clear orientation tuning that peaked at an orientation the same as the optimal orientation of the CRF response. The BMI administration did not change the orientation dependency of surround suppression. We also estimated the relative contribution of excitation and inhibition to the size and orientation tuning of surround suppression. It was concluded that cortical excitation and inhibition were well balanced, having similar tuning profiles for both stimulus size and orientation of the surround grating. Furthermore, surround stimuli used for V1 neurons suppressed the CRF response of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. These results suggest that surround suppression is not primarily attributable to the intracortical inhibition, but because of a reduction of thalamocortical inputs, which drive the cortical excitation and inhibition, and a subsequent decrease in the cortical excitatory interactions."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ER results in a sustained decrease in mass-adjusted energy expenditure (EE) that may oppose weight loss and promote weight regain. EE and body composition were measured in 10 adult neutered cats at 3 time points: baseline (obese cats), during weight loss (40% ER), and following weight regain. The cats started with a body weight (BW) of 6.1 +/- 0.30 kg, body condition score (BCS) of 7.6 +/- 0.14 (on a 9-point scale), and fat body mass (FM) of 38 +/- 1.0% of BW. After weight loss, BW was 5.0 +/- 0.19 kg, BCS was 5.5 +/- 0.07 kg, and FM was 31 +/- 1.6% (P < 0.01). After weight regain, BW was 6.2 +/- 0.30 kg, BCS was 7.7 +/- 0.16, and FM was 42 +/- 1.8% (P < 0.01). Total EE decreased from 1258 +/- 33.7 kJ/d to 1025 +/- 39.6 kJ/d during weight loss (P < 0.001). After weight regain, EE was still lower than baseline (1103 +/- 41.5 kJ/d, P < 0.001). Energy intake (EI) at baseline (1337 +/- 50.6 kJ/d) was higher than EI after weight loss and regain (1217 +/- 61.2 kJ/d), resulting in no differences in energy balance (78 +/- 30.4 and 104 +/- 35.4 kJ/d, respectively, P = 0.581). These results support the hypothesis that ER results in a mass-adjusted decrease in EE in cats that is maintained after weight regain."

Appropriate use of bisphosphonates for treating companion animals requires a thorough understanding of how bisphosphonates exert their biologic effects. This review article highlights general properties of bisphosphonates, including their pharmacology, mechanisms of action, adverse side effects, anticancer mechanisms, surrogate markers for assessing response, and potential clinical utility for treating dogs and cats diagnosed with malignant skeletal tumors."

Estimates of the number of house sparrows in the village at the start of the breeding season, and the number of sparrows known to have been caught by the cats, suggest that at least 30% of the sparrow deaths in the village were due to cats. Domestic cats would appear to be major predators in this typical English village."

    "abstract": "The species Ctenocephalides felis and Ctenocephalides canis are competent vectors for zoonotic pathogens such as Rickettsia felis and Bartonella spp. Improved knowledge on the diversity and phylogenetics of fleas is important for understanding flea-borne pathogen transmission cycles. Fleas infesting privately owned dogs and cats from the Czech Republic (n=97) and Romania (n=66) were subjected to morphological and molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis. There were a total of 59 (60.82%) cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis felis), 30 (30.93%) dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis), 7 (7.22%) European chicken fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae) and 1 (1.03%) northern rat flea (Nosopsyllus fasciatus) collected in the Czech Republic. Both C. canis and C. felis felis were identified in Romania. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing at the cox1 gene on a cohort of 40 fleas revealed the cosmopolitan C. felis felis clade represented by cox1 haplotype 1 is present in the Czech Republic. A new C. felis felis clade from both the Czech Republic and Romania is also reported. A high proportion of C. canis was observed from dogs and cats in the current study and phylogeny revealed that C. canis forms a sister clade to the oriental cat flea Ctenocephalides orientis (syn. C. felis orientis). Out of 33 fleas tested, representing C. felis felis, C. canis and Ce. gallinae, 7 (21.2%) were positive for R. felis using diagnostic real-time PCR targeting the gltA gene and a conventional PCR targeting the ompB gene. No samples tested positive for Bartonella spp. using a diagnostic real-time PCR assay targeting ssrA gene. This study confirms high genetic diversity of C. felis felis globally and serves as a foundation to understand the implication for zoonotic disease carriage and transmission by the flea genus Ctenocephalides."

All cats were free-ranging animals living in two protected areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In addition, 111 domestic dogs from nearby areas were sampled for CDV. Our results show the first evidence of CDV exposure in Brazilian free-ranging felids. From the 30 samples analyzed, six jaguars and one puma were tested seropositive for CDV. All seropositive large felids were from Ivinhema State Park, resulting in 31.5% of the sampled jaguars or 60% of the total jaguar population in Ivinhema State Park, and 11.28% of the sampled pumas. From the total 111 domestic dogs sampled, 45 were tested seropositive for CDV. At Morro do Diabo State Park, 34.6% of the dogs sampled were positive for CDV, and 100% at Ivinhema State Park. Canine distemper virus in wild felids seems to be related with home range use and in close association with domestic dogs living in nearby areas."

    "abstract": "In the primary visual cortex (V1), the response of a neuron to stimulation of its classical receptive field (CRF) is suppressed by concurrent stimulation of the extraclassical receptive field (ECRF), a phenomenon termed 'surround suppression'. It is also known that the orientation tuning of V1 neurons becomes sharper as the size of the stimulus increases beyond the CRF. However, there have been few quantitative investigations of the relationship between sharpening of orientation tuning and surround suppression. We examined this relationship in 73 V1 neurons recorded from anesthetized and paralysed cats using sinusoidal grating patches as stimuli. We found that sharpening of orientation tuning was significantly correlated with the strength of surround suppression for large stimuli that cover both CRF and ECRF. Furthermore, simulation analysis using a variety of tuning widths and most suppressive orientation of orientation-tuned surround suppression demonstrated that broadly orientation-tuned surround suppression sharpens orientation tuning for large gratings without shift in optimal orientation. Our findings suggest that one of the functional roles of surround suppression in V1 is enhancement of orientation discrimination for large and uniformly patterned objects."

Six of 68 (8.8%) and 11 of 68 (16.2%) cats were antibody positive to FIV and antigen positive for FeLV, respectively; 25 of 67 (37.3%) cats were seropositive to T. gondii. Antibodies to FeLV and T. gondii occurred in all age and sex classes, but FIV occurred only in adult males. Evidence of current or previous infections with two of these infectious agents was detected in eight of 64 cats (12.5%). Despite exposure to these infectious agents, feral cats remain abundant throughout the Hawaiian Islands."

    "abstract": "Control of Chagas disease requires control of its triatomine vectors, which requires an understanding of the determinants of infestation. Twenty-seven household environmental characteristics in the town of Chalcatzingo, Morelos, were analyzed for association with infestation by Triatoma pallidipennis, the predominant local vector. Data were obtained through timed household searches for triatomines and surveys that characterized intradomicile and peridomicile environments. Of the households surveyed, 28.4% were infested by T. pallidipennis. Cross-sectional multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed that regressed infestation on environmental variables. Of the 530 households in the town, 84% had sufficient data to be included. Adobe walls, agricultural products, junk piles, lack of bednets, and number of rabbits were significantly associated with intradomiciliary infestation. Junk piles and numbers of dogs, cats, and rabbits were significantly associated with peridomiciliary infestation. Junk piles, agricultural products, and numbers of cats, rabbits, and birds were significantly associated with overall infestation. Unexpectedly, presence of stone piles was not associated with infestation. The results of this study provide information for designing Chagas disease control programs in rural Mexican areas infested by T. pallidipennis."

    "abstract": "Changes in renal function of twenty-two cats treated for hyperthyroidism using radioiodine were evaluated. Serum thyroxine (T,), serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and urine specific gravity were measured before treatment and 6 and 30 days after treatment. Twenty-two cats had pretreatment and 21 cats had 6 day posttreatment measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using nuclear medicine imaging techniques. There were significant declines in serum T, at 6 days following treatment, but the changes in GFR, serum creatinine and BUN were not significant. At 30 days following treatment, there were significant increases in BUN and serum creatinine and further significant declines in serum T,. Nine cats were in renal failure prior to treatment and 13 cats were in renal failure 30 days following treatment. Renal failure was defined as BUN greater than 30 mg/dl and/or serum creatinine greater than 1.8 mgldl with concurrent urine specific gravity less than 1.035. These 13 cats included eight of 9 cats in renal failure prior to treatment and 5 cats not previously in renal failure. Follow up information beyond 30 days following treatment on 9 of these 13 cats indicated that all remained in renal failure. Based on receiver operating curve analysis of pretreatment glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in predicting posttreatment renal failure, a value of 2.25 ml/kg/min as a point of maximum sensitivity (100%) and specificity (78%) was derived. Fifteen of 22 cats had pretreatment GFR measurements of less than 2.25 ml/kg/min. These 15 cats included all 9 cats in renal failure and 5 cats with normal renal clinicopathologic values prior to treatment. At 30 days following treatment, 13 of these 15 cats were in renal failure. The 2 cats not in renal failure had persistently increased serum T, values. Seven of 22 cats had pretreatment GFR measurements greater than 2.25 ml/kg/min. None of these 7 cats was in renal failure at 30 days following treatment, all cats having normal BUN, serum creatinine, and urine specific gravity values. It was concluded that significant declines in renal function occur after treatment of hyperthyroidism and this decline is clinically im- portant in cats with renal disease. Pretreatment measurement of GFR is valuable in detecting subclin- ical renal disease and in predicting which cats may have clinically important declines in renal function following treatment."

    "abstract": "This paper descibes how intelligent agents can simulate human operators to aid in the analysis and design of complex systems. The paper presents to examples of adapting the Crew Activity Tracking System (CATS) to function as an intelligent agent. The first is a model-based design application, in which CATS agents perform the task of air traffic controllers in order to test a new operational concept. The second converns human error analysis, in which a coordinated team of CATS agents represents a flight crew and aircraft destroyed due to controlled flight into terrain. The paper also discusses issues regarding the development of task model-based agents that make plausible, human-like errors and the use of such agents."

    "abstract": "To explore the clinical significance of campylobacter infections for dogs and cats we compared intestinal carriage rates for Campylobacter sp. between animals with gastroenteritis and healthy controls. We cultured fecal specimens of 405 diarrheic dogs and 203 cats as well as 71 asymptomatic dogs and 35 cats using a selective medium in addition to filtration on a non-selective blood agar plate. We identified 224 campylobacter isolates using conventional phenotypic tests and DNA hybridization. There were 112 isolates, of C. upsaliensis, 43 C. jejuni and 69 other Campylobacter sp. For cats, there was no association between campylobacter carriage and disease, irrespective of the animals age. For dogs older than 12 months there was also no difference in campylobacter carriage rates between diarrheic and healthy animals. However, in younger dogs 44% of animals with diarrhea shed campylobacters in their feces, more than twice the rate in asymptomatic controls (21%), a significant difference. C. jejuni and C. upsaliensis contributed equally to this association between diarrhea and campylobacter prevalence. The parallel use of two culture methods enabled us to show that the recovery of Campylobacter sp. by filtration may be less than optimal and that filtering is probably unsuitable as a reference method for culturing C. upsaliensis. Finally we found that almost half of the campylobacter isolates from cats belong to a phenotypically homogeneous group of strains closely resembling C. upsaliensis but hybridizing only weakly with C. upsaliensis DNA."

Biostability of the hybrid assembly and the encapsulation materials were evaluated in pilot experiments in chronic implantations in a cat animal model. The implant was fabricated on a flexible polyimide substrate with integrated platinum electrode, interconnection lines, and contact pads for hybrid integration of electronic components. The receiver part was realized with four photodiodes connected in series. A parylene C coating was deposited on the electronic components as insulation layer. Silicone rubber was used to encapsulate the electronics in the shape of an artificial intraocular lens to allow proper implantation in the eye. Pilot experiments showed the biostability of the encapsulation approach and full electric functionality of the microimplant to generate stimulation currents over the implantation period of three months in two cats. In one cat, electrical stimulation of the retina evoked neuronal responses in the visual cortex and indicated the feasibility of the system approach for chronic use."

Fifty-nine peripheral nerve sheath tumors were collected from 53 cats. All of the tumors involved skin, subcutis, skeletal muscle, and/or mucous membranes. Histologically, the tumors were composed of compact to loosely arranged streams and fascicles of spindled cells with eosinophilic, often wavy cytoplasmic processes; small to occasionally moderate amounts of collagenous to myxoid matrix; and nuclear palisading. Immunohistochemically, all tumors were positive for vimentin and S-100 protein, 44 of 59 were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and all were negative for muscle specific actin. The tumors fell into 3 histologic categories: 34 benign tumors with Antoni A areas that were S-100 protein and GFAP positive, 9 benign tumors that lacked Antoni A areas and were S-100 protein positive and GFAP negative, and 16 tumors with features of malignancy. Seventy-five percent of these cases involved the head, neck, or limbs. Recurrent tumors were submitted or tumors were reported to have recurred in 9 cases. Tumor recurrence was reported for all 3 of the histologic subtypes. None was documented as having metastasized."

    "abstract": "Microsporidia are a ubiquitous group of obligate intracellular parasites that infect all major animal groups. Enterocytozoon bieneusi is the most commonly identified Microsporidia in humans and has also been reported worldwide in animals with importance in veterinary medicine (e.g. cats, dogs, horses, cattle and pigs). The identification of E. bieneusi in animals has raised the question of the importance of animal reservoirs in the epidemiology of this pathogen, and the implications of the infection with this pathogen in infected animals. Considerable genetic diversity within E. bieneusi has been found with over 90 genotypes identified based on the ITS nucleotide sequence of E. bieneusi spores recovered from the feces of infected humans and animals. Both host-adapted E. bieneusi genotypes with narrow host ranges and potentially zoonotic genotypes with wide host specificity have been identified. The information presented in this review should be useful in understanding the taxonomy, epidemiology, zoonotic potential, and importance in public health of E. bieneusi."

    "abstract": "A charge made against feeding dry foods to cats is that the high carbohydrate (i.e. starch) content results in high blood glucose levels which over time may have detrimental health effects. The present study determined the post-meal concentrations of plasma glucose and insulin in adult cats (seven males and four females) and dogs (Labrador retrievers; four males and five females) fed dry diets with low-starch (LS), moderate-starch (MS) or high-starch (HS) levels. In a cross-over design with at least 7 d between the test meals, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured following a single meal of a LS, MS and HS diet (209 kJ/kg bodyweight). Only the HS diet resulted in significant post-meal increases in plasma glucose concentration in cats and dogs although the time-course profiles were different between the species. In cats, plasma glucose concentration was significantly increased above the pre-meal concentration from 11 h until 19 h after the meal, while in dogs, a significant increase above baseline was seen only at the 7 h time point. Plasma insulin was significantly elevated in dogs 4-8 h following the MS diet and 2-8 h after the HS diet. In cats, plasma insulin was significantly greater than baseline from 3-7 and 11-17 h after the HS diet. The time lag (approximately 11 h) between eating the HS diet and the subsequent prolonged elevation of plasma glucose concentration seen in cats may reflect metabolic adaptations that result in a slower digestive and absorptive capacity for complex carbohydrate."

    "abstract": "Implanted wire electrodes are increasingly being used for the functional electrical stimulation of muscles in partially paralysed patients, yet many of their basic characteristics are poorly understood. In this study we investigated the selectivity, recruitment characteristics and range of control of several types of electrode in triceps surae and plantaris muscles of anaesthetized cats. We found that nerve cuffs are more efficient and selective (i.e., cause less stimulus spread to surrounding muscles) than intramuscular electrodes. Bipolar intramuscular stimulation was more efficient and selective than monopolar stimulation, but only if the nerve entry point was between the electrodes. Monopolar electrodes are efficient and selective if located close to the nerve entry point, but their performance declines with distance from it. Nonetheless, for a variety of reasons monopolar stimulation provides the best compromise in many current applications. Short duration pulses offer the best efficiency (least charge per pulse to elicit force) but high peak currents, increasing the risk of electrode corrosion and tissue damage. Electrode size has little effect on recruitment and should therefore be maximised because this minimises current density."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To measure intraocular pressure (IOP) and progesterone concentrations in cats and to examine their reproductive organs to determine whether reproductive status affects IOP in cats. ANIMALS:75 sexually intact domestic shorthair cats scheduled to be neutered, including 28 males, 21 females not in estrus, 13 females in estrus, and 13 pregnant females. PROCEDURES: Applanation tonometry was conducted to measure IOP and radioimmunoassay was used to determine progesterone concentrations. Reproductive organs were examined at time of surgery. RESULTS: The IOP in female cats that were in estrus was significantly higher than IOP in female cats that were not in estrus. Progesterone concentrations significantly affected IOP in pregnant cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In cats, IOP is affected by changes in reproductive status. Such changes should be considered when interpreting tonometry results in this species."

    "abstract": "Twenty-one feral cats were radio-tracked using direct sighting and triangulation techniques (amassing 730 location fixes) during winter in an agricultural landscape in central-western New South Wales. Factors affecting home-range size, home-range overlap and habitat use were assessed. Mean home-range size was 248 ha (s.e. = 34.9, n = 15 cats, 598 location fixes). Home-range size and habitat use were not influenced by sex or age of adult cats, prey abundance or time of day. However, cat weight significantly influenced range size, with heavier cats having larger ranges than smaller cats. Although the cats are apparently solitary, their home ranges overlapped considerably, particularly between young adults and old adult cats. Cats were active both by day and night and did not occupy permanent dens. Home ranges encompassed mixed habitat types that provided both shelter and prey. Open woodland and open forest were the main habitat types covered by home ranges, but within these areas cats showed a preference for grassland, where rabbits were more abundant. The results recorded in this study indicate that cat-control programs should concentrate in mixed habitat areas, where both shelter and food are available, and over widely dispersed areas. The absence of group living suggests that the effectiveness of virally vectored fertility or biological control agents would be limited."

    "abstract": "Objective—To determine whether changes in con- centrations of hormones involved in glucose and fatty acid homeostasis are responsible for the increased probability that neutered cats will develop obesity and diabetes mellitus. Animals—10 male and 10 female weight-maintained adult cats. Procedure—Results of glucose tolerance tests and concentrations of hormones and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were examined before and 4, 8, and 16 weeks after neutering. Results—Caloric requirements for weight mainte- nance were significantly decreased 8 and 16 weeks after neutering in females. Glucose concentrations during a glucose tolerance test did not change in neutered females or males. The area under the curve (AUC) for insulin was significantly higher in males, compared with females, before neutering. However, the AUC for insulin increased and was significantly higher 4 and 8 weeks after neutering in females. The AUC for insulin did not change in neutered male cats. Leptin concentrations did not change in females but increased significantly in males 8 and 16 weeks after neutering. Thyroxine concentrations did not change after neutering; however, free thyroxine concentration was significantly higher in females than males before neutering. Baseline concentrations of NEFA were sig- nificantly higher in female than male cats before but not after neutering. Suppression of NEFA concentra- tions after glucose administration decreased succes- sively in male cats after neutering, suggesting decreased insulin sensitivity. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Changes in NEFA suppression, caloric intake, and leptin concen- trations may be indicators of, and possible risk factors for, the development of obesity in cats after neuter- ing."

    "abstract": "We recently showed that four muscle synergies can reproduce multiple muscle activation patterns in cats during postural responses to support surface translations. We now test the robustness of functional muscle synergies, which specify muscle groupings and the active force vectors produced during postural responses under several biomechanically distinct conditions. We aimed to determine whether such synergies represent a generalized control strategy for postural control or if they are merely specific to each postural task. Postural responses to multidirectional translations at different fore-hind paw distances and to multidirectional rotations at the preferred stance distance were analyzed. Five synergies were required to adequately reconstruct responses to translation at the preferred stance distance-four were similar to our previous analysis of translation, whereas the fifth accounted for the newly added background activity during quiet stance. These five control synergies could account for > 80% total variability or r2 > 0.6 of the electromyographic and force tuning curves for all other experimental conditions. Forces were successfully reconstructed but only when they were referenced to a coordinate system that rotated with the limb axis as stance distance changed. Finally, most of the functional muscle synergies were similar across all of the six cats in terms of muscle synergy number, synergy activation patterns, and synergy force vectors. The robustness of synergy organization across perturbation types, postures, and animals suggests that muscle synergies controlling task-variables are a general construct used by the CNS for balance control."

    "abstract": "A series of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies conducted in humans has shown that aging is associated with a gradual decline in the maintenance energy requirement. Generally, this is equivalent to a total decrement of 20% of young adult maintenance energy requirements and is a result of a decrease in both physical activity and basal metabolic rate. Relatively few such studies have been conducted in dogs, but the results have been consistent. It appears that maintenance energy requirements decline by approximately 20%, and it is assumed that the causal factors are the same as those for humans. The situation appears to be somewhat different in cats, with evidence to date indicating that maintenance energy requirements remain constant throughout adult life. Why cats should be different from other species is not clear, but it is hypothesized that relative inactivity is typical of most cats' behavior, such that there is no obvious age-related change. In terms of feeding regimens for senior cats and dogs, it is appropriate to decrease energy provision for senior dogs by approximately 20%, whereas the energy provision for senior cats should not be decreased."

    "abstract": "This paper reviews recent work which points to critical neural circuitry involved in lasting changes in anxiety like behavior following unprotected exposure of rats to cats (predator stress). Predator stress may increase anxiety like behavior in a variety of behavioral tests including: elevated plus maze, light dark box, acoustic startle, and social interaction. Studies of neural transmission in two limbic pathways, combined with path and covariance analysis relating physiology to behavior, suggest long term potentiation like changes in one or both of these pathways in the right hemisphere accounts for stress induced changes in all behaviors changed by predator stress except light dark box and social interaction. Findings will be discussed within the context of what is known about neural substrates activated by predator odor."

This method rendered conduction velocity values for individual afferent and efferent myelinated fibers ranging from 27 to 120 m/sec, estimated with an uncertainty of ??5%. In addition, predictions from theoretical models relating extracellular potential amplitude, wavelength, and conduction velocity were confirmed experimentally for en passant records obtained from intact myelinated fibers. ?? 1981."

    "abstract": "Whereas hyperthyroidism is the most common endocrine disorder in the cat, hypothyroidism is the least common feline endocrine disorder. This is a the result of several factors including low index of suspicion, rarity of the naturally occurring hypothyroidism in cats, and a lack of species specific tests for endogenous TSH and antithyroglobulin antibodies. Nonetheless, hypothyroidism does occur in cats, especially in kittens and after radioactive treatment for hyperthyroidism. The clinician should become familiar with the common presentations of congenital and adult-onset hypothyroidism in cats. In addition, some of the tests specific to dogs (such as endogenous canine TSH) may be utilized to diagnose subclinical hypothyroidism in cats. Fortunately, the treatment of feline hypothyroidism with synthetic levothyroxine is both straightforward and effective."

    "abstract": "Cats can form a strong relationship toward the owner and seem to accept the advantages of living within a human family. However, cats can show behavioral problems, which are supposed to be largely due to owners' lack of knowledge or misunderstanding of feline behavior and needs. Therefore, the first period after adoption may be crucial in the development of a good cohabitation and relationship with the owner. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized set of behavioral advices provided to kitten owners in preventing the main undesirable behaviors in the domestic cat. Ninety-one cats divided into 2 groups were involved. Owners of the experimental group have been involved in the study in 2 steps. The first step was at the first veterinary visit of their pets, when kittens were 2.8 ?? 0.8 months old, and owners were provided with advice aimed to prevent behavioral problems. As a second step, they were interviewed 10 months later. Owners of the control group were met and interviewed only once, during the first vaccination recall visit. Results show that a significantly higher percentage of owners belonging to the control group (43.5% vs. 15.6%; ??2 = 7.214; P = 0.007) complained about one or more undesirable behaviors of their cat. Cats in the experimental group were more often reported to climb on some or specifically allowed furniture, while a greater number of cats in the control group climbed on every kind of furniture (??2 = 5.820; P = 0.016) and climbed on the curtains sometimes or frequently (??2 = 3.940; P = 0.047). Excessive vocalizations were also displayed more in the control group (21.7% vs. 4.4%; ??2 = 4.529; P = 0.033). Cats in the experimental group preferred seeking physical contact when the owners went back home, whereas cats belonging to the control group usually sought contact while owners were lying in the bed or on the sofa (??2 = 11.651; P = 0.011), possibly disturbing them. Moreover, a higher proportion of experimental group cats did not show a negative response to handling of any part of the body (82.2% vs. 58.7%; ??2 = 6.52; P = 0.010). The results of the present study support the hypothesis that providing owners with advice regarding their own behavior toward the cat and the appropriate education of their kitten leads to better informed owners and to fewer behaviors perceived as undesirable in cats."

Some introduced species, like corn (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum spp.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), plantation forests, domestic chicken (Gallus spp.), cattle (Bos taurus), and others, are beneficial and provide more than 98% of the world's food supply. Precise economic costs associated with some of the most ecologically damaging alien species are not available. Cats (Felis cattus) and pigs (Sus scrofa), for example, are responsible for the extinction of various animal species, however, it is impossible to assign monetary values to species forced to extinction. The estimate is that non-native species invasions in the six nations are causing more than US$ 314 billion per year in damages."

    "abstract": "Summary Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was first isolated from cats with immunodeficiency syndrome. Recently, neurological abnormalities and brain lesions were shown in cats infected with FIV. To investigate the FIV genome associated with central nervous system (CNS) lesions, proviral DNA sequences from the V3–V6 region of the FIVenv gene were directly amplified from uncultured necropsy tissues of a 2-year-old naturally FIV-infected cat with marked neurological symptoms and encephalitis. By in situ hybridization, FIV RNA was detected mainly in the astrocytes. Fifteen clones isolated from cerebrum, bone marrow and lymph node samples showed only a small number of mutations or deletions in this region. A representative clone, JN-BR1, was distantly related to the previous Japanese strain (TM2) belonging to the subtype B. However, it was relatively close to the Petaluma strain which is known to infect feline brain-derived culture cells and induce brain lesions in inoculated cats. By phylogenetic analysis, the JN-BR1 strain was placed in subtype A that included Petaluma strain and several other American and European strains. The JN-BR1 strain derived from brain with encephalitis in this study and the Petaluma strain may share a common genetic structure that is related to their neuropathogenicity."

    "abstract": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) mediates the facilitating effects of emotions on memory. The BLA's enhancing influence extends to various types of memories, including striatal-dependent habit formation. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we carried out unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings in BLA, striatum, auditory cortex and intralaminar thalamus in cats trained on a stimulus-response task in which the presentation of one of two tones predicted reward delivery. The coherence of BLA, but not of cortical or thalamic, LFPs was highest with striatal gamma activity, and intra-BLA muscimol infusions selectively reduced striatal gamma power. Moreover, coupling of BLA-striatal unit activity increased when LFP gamma power was augmented. Early in training, the rewarded and unrewarded tones elicited a modest increase in coherent BLA-striatal gamma. As learning progressed, this gamma coupling selectively increased in relation to the rewarded tone. Thus, coherent gamma oscillations coordinate amygdalostriatal interactions during learning and might facilitate synaptic plasticity."

    "abstract": "Relative abundance indices are often used to compare species abundance between sites. The indices assume that species have similar detection probabilities, or that differences between detection probabilities are known and can be corrected for. Indices often consist of encounter frequencies of footprints, burrows, markings or photo captures along trails or transect lines, but the assumption of equal detection probabilities is rarely validated. This study analyzes detection probabilities of a range of Neotropical mammals on trails in dense secondary forests, using camera-trap and track data. Photo captures of the two large cats, jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor), were correlated solely with trail variables, while photo captures of their potential prey species had no correlation or negative correlation with trail variables. The Neotropical mammals varied greatly in their tendency to follow or cross trails based on footprints surveys. This indicates that camera locations on trails will have varying detection probability for these Neotropical mammals. Even the two similar-sized jaguars and pumas, occupying relatively similar niches, differed subtly in their use of trails. Pumas followed trails more completely while jaguars were more likely to deviate from trails. The ecological significance of these findings is that jaguars seem to be more willing to use the forest matrix away from trails than do pumas. We conclude that trail-based indices, such as photographic captures or tracks along trails, are not appropriate for comparison between Neotropical species, and not even between relatively similar species like jaguars and pumas. © 2009 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation."

Doxapram was found to be a potent stimulus to the carotid chemoreceptors; the stimulation produced by 1.0 mg/kg doxapram, iv, equalled that produced by a Pao2 of 38 torr. Doxapram also increased phrenic-nerve activity in doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg, iv. After denervation of the peripheral chemoreceptors, doxapram in doses as large as 6 mg/kg failed to stimulate ventilation. It is concluded that (in anesthetized cats) doxapram in doses of less than 6 mg/kg increases ventilation by direct stimulation of the carotid, and, probably, the aortic, chemoreceptors, not by a direct effect on the medullary respiratory center."

    "abstract": "The Contract-based Air Transportation System (CATS) Project proposes an innovative air traffic management (ATM) solution able to face the challenge of traffic growth (for 2012+), and improves the efficiency of the European air transportation system. The CATS project will assess a new ATM paradigm based on an innovative operational concept: the contract of objectives (CoO). This concept introduces a new way of managing ATM using mutually agreed objectives, leading to a market-driven air transportation system (ATS). It addresses the air transport supply chain by reconciling operational links between air and ground services. This enhanced link between ground and air is expected to improve efficiency by increasing system predictability (allowing actors to organise themselves to be more cost efficient) and punctuality (arriving on time at the destination). Objectives are negotiated and assigned through collaborative decision-making processes. CATS proposes, through applying the CoO, one of the possible implementations of the SESAR business trajectory. The CATS Consortium1, consisting of some main stakeholders in the air transportation system, submitted a proposal to the European Commission, through a call in the Sixth Framework Programme. The aim of the CATS project is to develop and assess the concepts of the contract of objectives and target windows from various perspectives. The validation will be accomplished through three human-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments, focusing on the evaluation of this CoO concept between ATCOs, between ATCOs and aircrew, and lastly between all the actors (airports, airlines, ANSPs., etc.) involved in the renegotiation process, if the CoO cannot be met. The assessment will focus on system performances [8], while evaluating the impact of this CoO in terms of human performances (to see if the contribution of the human to overall system performances is within expected capabilities) and safety. Particular attention will be paid to the cost-benefit analysis and the legal implications. The validation will ensure that the resulting concept provides some substantial benefits and is “fit for purpose”."

METHODS: Cardiovascular reactivity was examined among 240 married couples, half of whom owned a pet. Mental arithmetic and cold pressor were performed in one of four randomly assigned social support conditions: alone, with pet or friend (friend present for non-pet owners), with spouse, with spouse and pet/friend. RESULTS: Relative to people without pets, people with pets had significantly lower heart rate and blood pressure levels during a resting baseline, significantly smaller increases (ie, reactivity) from baseline levels during the mental arithmetic and cold pressor, and faster recovery. Among pet owners, the lowest reactivity and quickest recovery was observed in the pet-present conditions. CONCLUSIONS: People perceive pets as important, supportive parts of their lives, and significant cardiovascular and behavioral benefits are associated with those perceptions."

    "abstract": "Neuronal connections and pathways underlying sacculocollic reflexes were studied by intracellular recordings from neck extensor and flexor motoneurons in decerebrate cat. Bipolar electrodes were placed within the left saccular nerve, whereas other branches of the vestibular nerve were removed in the inner ear. To prevent spread of stimulus current to other branches of the vestibular nerve, the saccular nerve and the electrodes were covered with warm semisolid paraffin-Vaseline mixture. Saccular nerve stimulation evoked disynaptic (1.8-3.0 ms) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in ipsilateral neck extensor motoneurons and di- or trisynaptic (1.8-4.0 ms) EPSPs in contralateral neck extensor motoneurons, and di- and trisynaptic (1.7-3.6 ms) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in ipsilateral neck flexor motoneurons and trisynaptic (2.7-4.0 ms) IPSPs in contralateral neck flexor motoneurons. Ipsilateral inputs were about twice as strong as contralateral ones to both extensor and flexor motoneurons. To determine the pathways mediating this connectivity, the lateral part of the spinal cord containing the ipsilateral lateral vestibulospinal tract (i-LVST) or the central part of the spinal cord containing the medial vestibulospinal tracts (MVSTs) and possibly reticulospinal fibers (RSTs) were transected at the caudal end of the C1 segment. Subsequent renewed intracellular recordings following sacculus nerve stimulation indicated that the pathway from the saccular nerve to the ipsilateral neck extensor motoneurons projects though the i-LVST, whereas the pathways to the contralateral neck extensors and to the bilateral neck flexor motoneurons descend in the MVSTs/RSTs. Our data show that sacculo-neck reflex connections display a qualitatively bilaterally symmetrical innervation pattern with excitatory connections to both neck extensor motoneuron pools, and inhibitory connections to both neck flexor motoneuron pools. This bilateral organization contrasts with the unilateral innervation scheme of the utriculus system. These results suggest a different symmetry plane along which sacculus postural reflexes are organized, thus supplementing the reference planes of the utriculus system and allowing the gravistatic system to represent all three translational spatial degrees of freedom. We furthermore suggest that the sacculocollic reflex plays an important role in maintaining the relative position of the head and the body against the vertical linear acceleration of gravity."

    "abstract": "Feral cats are directly responsible for a large percentage of global extinctions, particularly on islands. We reviewed feral cat eradication programs with the intent of providing information for future island conservation actions. Most insular cat introductions date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, whereas successful eradication programs have been carried out in the last 30 years, most in the last decade. Globally, feral cats have been removed from at least 48 islands: 16 in Baja California (Mexico), 10 in New Zealand, 5 in Australia, 4 in the Pacific Ocean, 4 in Seychelles, 3 in the sub-Antarctic, 3 in Macaronesia (Atlantic Ocean), 2 in Mauritius, and 1 in the Caribbean. The majority of these islands (75%; n = 36) are small (less than or equal to5 km(2)). The largest successful eradication campaign took place on Marion Island (290 km(2)), but cats have been successfully removed from only 10 islands (21%) of greater than or equal to 10 km(2). On Cousine Island (Seychelles) cat density reached 243 cats/km(2), but on most islands densities did not exceed 79.2 cats/km(2) (n = 22; 81%). The most common methods in successful eradication programs were trapping and hunting (often with dogs; 91% from a total of 43 islands). Frequently, these methods were used together. Other methods included poisoning (1080; monofluoracetate in fish baits, n = 13; 31%), secondary poisoning from poisoned rats (n = 4; 10%), and introduction of viral disease (feline panleucopaenia; n = 2; 5%). Impacts from cat predation and, more recently, the benefits of cat eradications have been increasingly documented. These impacts and benefits, combined with the continued success of eradication campaigns on larger islands, show the value and role of feral cat eradications in biodiversity conservation. However, new and more efficient techniques used in combination with current techniques will likely be needed for success on larger islands."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the history, factor structure and psychometric properties of the Children’s Automatic Thoughts Scale (CATS). The CATS is a self-report measure designed to assess a wide range of negative self-statements in children and adolescents. The results of confirmatory factor analyses supported four distinct but strongly correlated factors relating to automatic thoughts on physical threat, social threat, personal failure and hostility. The internal consistency of the total score and subscales was high and test–retest reliability at 1 and 3 months was acceptable. The CATS effectively discriminated between control children and adolescents, and clinically anxious, depressed, or behavior disorder children and adolescents, and showed good discriminant validity across clinical subgroups on the subscales. Results suggest that the CATS is a promising instrument in the assessment of a range of negative automatic thoughts across both internalizing and externalizing problems in young people."

Because quantum\\nphysics allow atoms to remain in superpositions of states, the classical\\ncat would then be simultaneously dead and alive. By analogy, a cat\\nstate of freely propagating light can be defined as a quantum superposition\\nof well separated quasiclassical statesit is a classical light\\nwave that simultaneously possesses two opposite phases. Such states\\nplay an important role in fundamental tests of quantum theory and\\nin many quantum information processing tasks, including quantum computation8,\\nquantum teleportation and precision measurements11. Recently, optical\\nSchroedinger kittens were prepared; however, they are too small\\nfor most of the aforementioned applications and increasing their\\nsize is experimentally challenging. Here we demonstrate, theoretically\\nand experimentally, a protocol that allows the generation of arbitrarily\\nlarge squeezed Schroadinger cat states, using homodyne detection\\nand photon number states as resources. We implemented this protocol\\nwith light pulses containing two photons, producing a squeezed Schroadinger\\ncat state with a negative Wigner function. This state clearly exhibits\\nseveral quantum phase-space interference fringes between the dead\\nand alive components, and is large enough to become useful for\\nquantum information processing and experimental tests of quantum\\ntheory."

    "abstract": "The human squamous cell carcinoma antigens (SCCA) 1 and 2 are members of the serpin family that are 92% identical in their amino acid sequence. Despite this similarity, they inhibit distinct classes of proteinases. SCCA1 neutralizes the papain-like cysteine proteinases, cathepsins (cat) S, L, and K; and SCCA2 inhibits the chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases, catG and human mast cell chymase. SCCA2 also can inhibit catS, as well as other papain-like cysteine proteinases, albeit at a rate 50-fold less than that of SCCA1. Analysis of the mechanism of inhibition by SCCA1 revealed that the reactive site loop (RSL) is important for cysteine proteinase inhibition. The inhibition of catS by a mutant SCCA2 containing the RSL of SCCA1 is comparable to that of wild-type SCCA1. This finding suggested that there were no motifs outside and only eight residues within the RSL that were directing catS-specific inhibition. The purpose of this study was to determine which of these residues might account for the marked difference in the ability of SCCA1 and SCCA2 to inhibit papain-like cysteine proteinases. SCCA2 molecules containing different RSL mutations showed that no single amino acid substitution could convert SCCA2 into a more potent cysteine proteinase inhibitor. Rather, different combinations of mutations led to incremental increases in catS inhibitory activity with residues in four positions (P1, P3', P4', and P11') accounting for 80% of the difference in activity between SCCA1 and SCCA2. Interestingly, the RSL cleavage site differed between wild-type SCCA2 and this mutant. Moreover, these data established the importance of a Pro residue in the P3' position for efficient inhibition of catS by both wild-type SCCA1 and mutated SCCA2. Molecular modeling studies suggested that this residue might facilitate positioning of the RSL within the active site of the cysteine proteinase."

    "abstract": "We evaluated variable patterns of pudendal nerve (PN) stimuli for reflex bladder excitation. Reflex activation of the bladder has been demonstrated previously with 20-33 Hz continuous stimulation of PN afferents. Neuronal circuits accessed by afferent mediated pathways may respond better to physiological patterned stimuli than continuous stimulation. Unilateral PN nerve cuffs were placed in neurologically intact male cats. PN stimulation (0.5-100 Hz) was performed under isovolumetric conditions at bladder volumes up to the occurrence of distension evoked reflex contractions. Stimulus evoked reflex bladder contractions were elicited in eight cats. Across all experiments, bursting of 2-10 pulses at 100-200 Hz repeated at continuous stimulation frequencies evoked significantly larger bladder responses than continuous (single pulse) stimulation (52.0+/-44.5%). Bladder excitation was also effective at 1 Hz continuous stimuli, which is lower than typically reported. Variable patterned pulse bursting resulted in greater evoked reflex bladder pressures and increased the potential stimulation parameter space for effective bladder excitation. Improved bladder excitation should increase the efficacy of neuroprostheses for bladder control."

    "abstract": "Radiographs of vertebral segments from 200 cats were retrospectively assessed to determine the incidence of congenital axial skeletal abnormalities. The axial skeleton was divided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal segments and the presence and types of congenital abnormalities present were recorded for each segment. A total of 598 axial skeletal segments were examined. Congenital abnormalities were found in 46 cats and involved 54 spinal segments. Block vertebrae were identified in three cats. No hemivertebrae or spina bifida were noted. Transitional abnormalities were most common, and were identified in 51 spinal segments. Abnormalities at the sacrocaudal junction were the most common of these; 19 examples were found. The second most common transitional abnormality was thoracicization of L1, with 18 such cats identified. Extra ribs on L1 were often smaller and fragmented and it may be possible for an inexperienced clinician to confuse these with rib fractures. The last rib(s) are also often used for anatomic localization of surgical procedures; the presence of a transitional lumbar vertebra with one or two extra ribs introduces the possibility of error or confusion about choice of surgical site."

We found that kittens younger than 30 days of age generated only a small rise in temperature in response to a standardized endotoxin challenge that consistently causes fever in adult cats. Some degree of febrile response was present at birth, but the dose of pyrogen necessary to elicit a fever was 10-15 times greater than that required in the adult. There was a gradual increase in both magnitude and duration of fever as a function of age with the largest change occurring after 30 days of age. There was a direct relationship between the ability of the kitten to maintain its body temperature (Tbo) at the room ambient (Ta) and the magnitude of the elicited fever. However, increasing the Ta to thermoneutral (Ta = 30-32 ??C) did not enhance the thermal response indicating that the failure to elicit the fever is not due to passive effects of Tna. These data suggest that the febrile response to an endotoxin over the first 6-7 weeks of the kitten's life and are discussed in re;ation to other physical variables of development. ?? 1988."

    "abstract": "Pudendal nerve (PN) stimulation and intraurethral stimulation via a catheter have been demonstrated previously to trigger reflex bladder contractions for 20-40 Hz and 2 & 20 Hz continuous stimuli, respectively. However, thorough studies of the stimulation parameter space and optimal urethral locations are required for translation to clinical feasibility studies for potential neural prostheses. Stimulation-evoked bladder activation was evaluated in fourteen male cats via PN stimulation or intraurethral stimulation before and after spinal transection. In all testing scenarios, the use of pulse bursting led to a greater evoked bladder pressure than with single-pulse continuous waveforms. PN stimulation evoked contractions with 1 Hz and 33 Hz stimuli before spinalization in eight cats. Post-spinalization testing in four cats only elicited excitation for 33 Hz stimuli. For PN stimulation, spinalization eliminated the excitability of low frequency stimulation. Intraurethral stimulation in the proximal and prostatic urethra (2 Hz and 33 Hz range stimuli) and the distal urethra (33 Hz range stimuli) evoked contractions in six cats before spinalization. After spinalization, intraurethral testing in five cats only evoked contractions in the distal and prostatic urethra using 33 Hz range stimuli. For intraurethral stimulation, spinalization eliminated both proximal and low frequency responses. This research improves the knowledge base of several main factors involved in the development of neuroprostheses for bladder control - optimal stimulation paradigms and the understanding of lower urinary tract neurophysiology."

    "abstract": "Arterial thromboembolism is a rare disease in cats with an estimated prevalence of less than 0.57%. The outcome is often disastrous. The most commonly identified underlying cause is a form of cardiomyopathy. Thromboemboli usually tend to lodge near the aorta trifurcation, causing extreme pain, paralysis of the rear limbs, no palpable pulse wave, and cold rear limbs. Treatment is aimed at palliation, thrombolysis, and prevention of recurrence of thrombus formation. The prognosis is usually guarded and medical treatment tends not to influence the outcome markedly. In this review, we describe the pathophysiology, common clinical features, diagnostics, and treatment of arterial thromboembolism in cats. We also summarize risk factors and new developments in prevention and treatment."

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the infection with gastrointestinal helminthes in small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) and its epidemiologic aspects in Iran. Methods: During June 2012 to July 2013, a total of 13 small Indian mongooses were caught using live trap boxes in an area located near Shiraz, southern of Iran. Captured animals were euthanized, eviscerated and parts of the alimentary tract were inspected. Two mongooses showed a nematode attached to the mucosa of the stomach. Results: According to the main morphological characteristics, the specimens belonged to the genus Spirura (Blanchard 1849). This study represents the first evidences of the infection with Spirura sp. in Herpestes auropunctatus in the world. Conclusions: Because the animal can invade and appear in the habitat of the other animal populations including omnivores or carnivores, it seems that mongooses in this area could have a high potential for the transmission of the infection with the spirurid nematodes to a large range of animals. Thus, besides the necessity of conducting the controlling programs, autochthonous dogs, cats and rodents should be included in more epidemiological studies in this region."

    "abstract": "The common form of spontaneous diabetes mellitus that occurs in domestic cats bears close resemblance clinically and pathologically to human type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). For example, the typical diabetic cat is obese and middle-aged, and has low but detectable circulating insulin levels. However, the most striking similarity is the occurrence of islet amyloidosis (IA) in nearly all diabetic cats and in over 90% of humans with T2DM. IA in both humans and cats is derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, or amylin) which is a hormone produced and secreted along with insulin by the pancreatic beta cells. Since all cats and humans normally produce IAPP, additional factors must be invoked in order to explain the development of IA. Several lines of evidence support the concept that IA is caused by chronically increased stimulus for beta cells to secrete IAPP (and insulin). For example, peripheral insulin resistance such as in chronic obesity results in increased IAPP and insulin secretion. A recent study, in which diabetes mellitus was induced in cats, demonstrated that IAPP hypersecretion was induced by treatment with a sulfonylurea drug and resulted in 4/4 cats in this group developing IA. In contrast, cats treated with insulin had low IAPP secretion and minimal IA developed in 1/4 cats. Several human-IAPP transgenic mouse models, in which there is IAPP overexpression, also support the notion that prolonged high expression of IAPP leads to IA. In vitro models of IAPP overexpression also support this mechanism for IA formation and by demonstrating an association between IA formation and beta cell toxicity, suggest a linkage between IA formation and loss of beta cells in T2DM. A recent study has indicated that intermediate-sized IAPP-derived amyloid fibrils can disrupt cell membranes and therefore, may be involved in the destruction of beta cells. Striking parallels between the pathogenesis of IA and beta-amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease suggest possible parallel pathogenetic mechanisms of cell death and provide potential avenues for future studies into the pathogenesis of IA."

Chronic renal failure can suppress total T4 concentrations in cats with concurrent hyperthyroidism, and free T4 is not a useful distinguishing test. Medical therapy (ie, methimazole) is recommended in cats with pre-existing CRF. Overt renal failure occurs in approximately 30% of cats treated for hyperthyroidism. It usually occurs within one month of treatment and tends to remain mild and stable over time. There is no practical way to predict which cats will develop CRF after treatment of hyperthyroidism, although GFR measurement does seem useful."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of feline diabetes mellitus has increased several-fold over the last three decades. In humans, progression from obesity to diabetes is marked by changes in the release of proinsulin. A specific proinsulin (FPI) assay has not been available to examine similar changes in cats. The goal of this study was to develop a proinsulin assay for the analysis of beta cell function in cats. Monoclonal antibodies were developed against recombinant FPI and used in a two-site sandwich immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The antibody pair had negligible cross-reactivity with bovine insulin and feline C-peptide. The working range was 11-667pmol/L for the IRMA and 11-1111pmol/L for the ELISA. An intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed in six long-term obese and six lean adult healthy cats and serum glucose, insulin, and FPI concentrations were determined. The proinsulin and insulin secretion pattern in response to glucose was significantly different between lean and obese cats but the pattern was similar within a group. Both groups had similar baseline proinsulin/insulin ratios; however, obese cats showed a significantly higher proinsulin/insulin ratio during the first 15min of the IVGTT and a much lower ratio during the last 30min suggesting a time-delayed adjustment to the increased insulin demand. In conclusion, we report the development and validation of an IRMA and an ELISA for FPI. This novel assay is useful to elucidate FPI secretion and can be used similar to a C-petide assay to evaluate residual beta cell function in cats."

    "abstract": "Elevated intrathoracic pressure due to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has the potential for increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) and reducing arterial blood pressure (BP). Such changes could critically reduce cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = BP - ICP), This possibility was investigated in 15 cats with artificially-produced expanding intracranial masses (intracranial balloon). The interrelationships among ICP and central venous and arterial pressures were observed during application and removal of graded levels of PEEP (5, 10, 15 cm H2O). The electroencephalogram and pupillary diameters were monitored. At various levels of ICP, nine of the cats were given oleic acid intravenously to embolize the lung and cause pulmonary dysfunction. In cats not given oleic acid, PEEP caused a maximal reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure of 45 +/- 4 torr(SEM), accompanied by variable changes in ICP. PEEP application in the absence of oleic acid embolization of the lungs caused electroencephalographic abnormalities in 77% of these cats, while pupillary diameters increased in 56%. Animals embolized wwith oleic acid had significantly less (P less than .001) severe CPP reductions (mean 21 +/- 4 torr) than did the non-embolized animals, and developed no EEG change due to PEEP. However, increases in pupillary diameter still occurred in 33% of cats given oleic acid when PEEP was applied. In 82% of the PEEP applications (n = 44) in both experimental groups only insignificant increases in intracranial tension occurred (average peak ICP gain less than 1.5 torr). Abrupt increases in ICP exceeding 11 torr (15 cm H2O) occurred in four animals in each group. This happened most frequently (63 per cent) when the intracranial tension before PEEP was above 15 torr. Sudden removal of or reduction in PEEP was accompanied by increases in arterial and intracranial pressures in both groups, although this response was attenuated in the cats given oleic acid. The results indicate a potential for PEEP to evoke neurolgic complications in patients who have intracranial disease and that the presence of pulmonary disease may attenuate these deleterious side effects. Monitoring of neurologic function as well as blood-gas and cardiovascular effects of PEEP in patients who have intracranial disease is suggested."

We divide features of the documents into five types: features for visual layout, linguistically modeled syntactic features, stylo-metric features, features for semantic structure, and contextual features as an object linked to previously classified objects and other external sources. Results concerning the first two types have been described elsewhere(29). The current paper discusses results from testing classifiers based on image and stylometric features and shows that genres for which image features fail to cluster are the genres for which stylo-metric features cluster very well."

    "abstract": "Thirteen cats, newly diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, were treated with a transdermal formulation of methimazole at a dose of 5 mg (0.1 mL) (concentration of 50 mg/mL) applied to the internal ear pinna every 12 h for 28 d. Baseline hematologic and biochemical values, along with serum thyroxine (T4) levels, were obtained on presentation (day 0). Cats were evaluated at 14 d (D14) and 28 d (D28) following transdermal therapy. At each visit, a physical examination, a complete blood cell count, a serum biochemical analysis, and a serum T4 evaluation were performed. Ten cats completed the study. Clinical improvement, as well as a significant decrease in T4, was noted in all cats. Serum T4 measured at D14 and D28 were significantly lower at 27.44 nmol/L, s = 37.51 and 14.63 nmol/L, s = 10.65, respectively (P < 0.0001), as compared with values at D0 (97.31 nmol/L, s = 37.55). Only 1 cat showed a cutaneous adverse reaction along with a marked thrombocytopenia. The results of this prospective clinical study suggest that transdermal methimazole is an effective and safe alternative to conventional oral formulations."

    "abstract": "Objectives i) To establish the seroprevalence of Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) infection in two defined groups of cats in Sydney: owned and feral cats; ii) to identify factors associated with an increased risk of infection with FCoV; and iii) to establish the seroprevalence and FCoV antibody titres of owned cats with immunohistochemically confirmed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Design Prospective multi-institutional cross sectional study. Procedure Serum samples from owned cats presented to three inner city veterinary clinics in Sydney and feral cats from a colony in South Western Sydney over an 11-month period were tested for FCoV antibodies using the Immunocomb(R) test kit. The relationship between serological score and six major factors (breed, age, gender, number of cats per household, living environment and health status) in the owned cat sample population was analysed and compared to cats with FIP. Results The seroprevalence of FCoV infection in the sample population of owned and feral cats was 34% and 0%, respectively. The median Immunocomb(R) scores of DSH, Persian, Siamese and Devon Rex cats were significantly lower than that of Burmese, BSH, Abyssinian, Birman, Ragdoll and Russian Blue. The median Immunocomb(R) score of pedigree cats less than 2 years-of-age was significantly higher than for pedigree cats greater than 2 years-of-age. This distinction was not evident in DSH cats in these age groups. The number of cats per household at the time of blood collection had a strong positive association with Immunocomb(R) score. The median Immunocomb(R) score of cats with immunohistochemically confirmed FIR was significantly higher than cats in the sample population of owned cats but there was sufficient overlap between these two groups to make definitive diagnosis of FIP by serology impossible. Conclusion This represents the first seroprevalence study of FCoV in Australia. The major determinants of antibody score of owned cats identified in this study were breed, age and the number of cats per household. The significant relationship between the breed of the cat and the FCoV antibody titre further supports the notion, proposed previously by the authors, that breed related differences exist in the immunological response to FCoV infection."

Ninety-two percent of reported rabid animals were wildlife. Relative contributions by the major animal groups were as follows: 1,898 raccoons (32.4%), 1,598 bats (27.2%), 1,447 skunks (24.7%), 344 foxes (5.9%), 247 cats (4.2%), 86 cattle (1.5%), and 89 dogs (1.5%). One human case was reported from Maryland. The infection was determined to have been transmitted via organ transplantation. Infection in the organ donor, a North Carolina resident, was retrospectively diagnosed. Both the organ donor and the organ recipient were infected with the raccoon rabies virus variant. The third human case, reported by Texas, involved a Guatemalan resident who was detained while crossing the US border. The infection was determined to be caused by a canine rabies virus variant that circulates in Central America."

    "abstract": "Detection of bladder volume and hyperreflexive bladder contractions would be useful in individuals with overactive bladders. We sought to determine whether bladder filling and/or reflex bladder contractions could be detected by electrical recording from the sacral nerve roots, and whether bladder contractions could be inhibited by stimulation of sacral afferents. Six male cats were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose and bipolar cuff electrodes were used to measure sacral nerve root electroneurograms (ENG) during slow bladder filling, during rapid injections of fluid into the bladder, and during hyperreflexia-like bladder contractions. The rectified and time-averaged activity of the S1 extradural root increased by 0-5 % above the baseline during bladder filling. Rapid injections caused a sudden increase in bladder pressure, and a 3-36 % increase over baseline in the S1 nerve activity. Withdrawal of the same volume caused a reduction in pressure and a decrease in recorded activity (4-14 %). At the onset of a bladder contraction, there was a 7-38 % increase over baseline in the S1 nerve activity. This activity increase was sustained for the duration of the contraction and decreased during bladder relaxation. The onset and duration of bladder contractions could be detected consistently from these nerve activity changes. Recording only afferent activity showed that the increased nerve activity was due to S1 sensory rather than motor fibers. In two cats, it was demonstrated that an ongoing bladder contraction could be inhibited by rectal distension. In one cat, the contractions could be terminated by electrical stimulation of the S1 dorsal root. The results demonstrate that afferent sacral root nerve activity can be used to detect hyperreflexive bladder contractions at low bladder pressures. Such a signal might be used to trigger bladder inhibition via electrical stimulation of specific sacral afferents."

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the pathophysiological response of the cochlea following long-term intracochlear electrical stimulation using a poorly charge-balanced stimulus regime, leading to direct current (DC) levels >0.1 microA. Four normal-hearing adult cats were bilaterally implanted with scala tympani electrode arrays and unilaterally stimulated for periods up to 2200 h. Stimuli consisted of 50 micros monophasic current pulses presented at 2000 pulses per second (pps) per channel, and resulted in DC levels of 0.4-2.8 microA. Both acoustic and electrical (EABR) evoked potentials were periodically recorded during the stimulation program. Frequency-specific stimuli indicated that an extensive and widespread hearing loss occurred over the 4-24 KHz region in all stimulated cochleae, although the 2 KHz region exhibited thresholds close to normal in some animals, despite long-term implantation and chronic stimulation. Longitudinal EABRs showed a statistically significant increase in threshold for three of the four animals. Histopathological evaluation of the cochleae revealed a highly significant reduction in ganglion cell density in stimulated cochleae compared with their controls. Spiral ganglion cell loss was significantly correlated with the degree of inflammation, duration of electrical stimulation, and the level of DC. In conclusion, the present study highlights the potential for neural damage following stimulation using poorly charge-balanced stimuli."

We showed previously that keeping cats after noise trauma in an acoustic environment enriched in high frequencies prevents tonotopic map reorganization. Here, we show the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency enriched acoustic environments on spontaneous firing rate and neural synchrony. Exposed cats placed in the quiet environment and in the low-frequency enriched acoustic environment showed increased spontaneous firing rate and synchrony of firing. In contrast, exposed cats placed in the high-frequency enriched acoustic environment did not show significant differences in spontaneous firing rate or synchrony compared with normal hearing controls. This is interpreted as an absence of putative neural signs of tinnitus."

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) and thoracic radiography were performed in nonsedated, nonanesthetized, cats with thoracic disease. The final diagnosis was obtained with echocardiography, cytology, histopathology, necropsy, or response to therapy. For CT imaging, cats were in a positioning device using a 16 multislice helical CT system. Fifty-four cats had CT imaging of which 50 had thoracic radiography. The most common diagnoses were lung neoplasia, lower airway disease, and cardiomyopathy (nine each). Other disease groups included mediastinal mass (eight), infection (seven), trauma (four), and hernia (three). CT provided additional correct diagnoses in 28% (14/50) and additional information in 74% (37/50) of the cats. Additional correct diagnoses achieved only with CT were most common for cats with lower airway disease. The most common additional findings with CT were lung nodules (n=4), lung masses (n=4), bronchiectasis (n=4), and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (n=3). Survey CT led to a significant different diagnosis or different prognosis in 20 of the 50 cats that were imaged both modalities. Contrast CT was performed in 19 cats, most commonly in cats with lung neoplasia (n=6), a mediastinal mass (n=4) or an infection (n=3), and provided additional correct diagnosis in two cats not achieved with survey CT. Thoracic CT using a positioning device in diseased awake cats is feasible, safe, and clinically useful."
